        <p>History is repeating again. MongoDB is breaking out of the niche into the
mainstream, performance and instrumentation are terrible in specific cases,
MongoDB isn&rsquo;t able to fix all the problems alone, and an ecosystem is growing.</p>

        I have followed the &ldquo;Use the Index, Luke!&rdquo; blog for a while. Today Marcus wrote that (I&rsquo;ll paraphrase) MongoDB disgraces NoSQL the same way that MySQL disgraces SQL. I agree with a lot of this, actually, although I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d put it so strongly. People often like products for good reasons, and to think that legions of developers are stupid or ill-educated is suspect, in my opinion.
But that wasn&rsquo;t what I meant to write about.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 29, 2013</span>
        Last week Tokutek announced that they&rsquo;re open-sourcing their TokuDB storage engine for MySQL. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with TokuDB, it&rsquo;s an ACID-compliant storage engine with a high-performance index technology known as fractal tree indexing. Fractal trees have a number of nice characteristics, but perhaps the most interesting is that they deliver consistently high performance under varying conditions, such as when data grows much larger than memory or is updated frequently. B-tree indexes tend to get fragmented over time, and exhibit a performance cliff when data doesn&rsquo;t fit in memory anymore.

        In case you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock for the last 5 years, the NoSQL movement has changed. There was a time when everyone &ndash; EVERYONE &ndash; was dumping on relational databases, and MySQL in particular. Nonsense like &ldquo;SQL itself is inherently unscalable&rdquo; routinely came out of the mouths of otherwise usually sensible people. But that&rsquo;s cooled off a little bit, thank heavens.
And what&rsquo;s the new hotness? Well, Big Data, of course!

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Aug 23, 2012</span>
        Although not perfect, MySQL replication was probably the killer feature that made MySQL the default database for web applications some time ago. Since then, MySQL replication has been improved greatly, with such notable changes as row-based replication. At the same time, the replication engineering team has made MySQL replication more conservative and less forgiving of foot-gun errors. These have gone a long way towards helping users avoid some of the problems that made replication sometimes drift out of sync with the master copy, sometimes silently.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 9, 2012</span>
        MySQL became wildly successful in part because it had built-in, simple replication. Sure, it had lots of interesting failure scenarios and was not great at first &mdash; it is much better these days &mdash; but it was nevertheless successful because there was a single, out-of-the-box, not-very-complex way to do replication. I have opined many times before that this was one of the killer features missing from PostgreSQL. I think that can large explain why MySQL became more popular more quickly.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 29, 2011</span>
        I&rsquo;ll be presenting several sessions at the O&rsquo;Reilly MySQL Conference &amp; Expo 2011, which is April 11-14 in Santa Clara, California. I recommend this conference to anyone interested in open-source databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, CouchDB, MongoDB, and others. There is very good coverage of a diverse list of open-source databases.
My sessions are as follows:
 Building on Strengths, Learning from Differences: a keynote address on the open-source database ecosystem, how we got here, and what we can do to make the most of the future.

        I&rsquo;ve released version 1.1.8 of the Better Cacti Templates project. This release includes a bunch of bug fixes and several important new graphs. There are graphs for the new response-time statistics exposed in Percona Server, and a new set of graphs for MongoDB.
 VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti.

Take a look at the full schedule listing, which is being filled out as talks are approved and the speakers verify that they&rsquo;ll give the session.
I am certainly looking forward to this year&rsquo;s event. A tremendous amount of progress has landed in GA versions of open-source databases this year. To name just a couple, there&rsquo;s a new version of Postgres (9.

        MongoDB, the Definitive Guide  MongoDB, the Definitive Guide, by Kristina Chodorow and Michael Dirolf, 2010. About 200 pages. (Here&rsquo;s a link to the publisher&rsquo;s site.)
This is a good introduction to MongoDB, mostly from the application developer&rsquo;s point of view. After reading through this, I felt that I understood the concepts well, although I am not a MongoDB expert, so I can&rsquo;t pretend to be a fact-checker. The topics are clearly and logically presented for the most part; there is a small amount of repetition in one of the appendixes, but I don&rsquo;t mind that.

        In addition to the Boston edition, there&rsquo;s an OpenSQL Camp at the same time and place as FrOSCon mid-August in Germany. The call for papers is open until July 11th. As always, the conference is about all kinds of open-source databases: MySQL and PostgreSQL are only two of the obvious ones; MongoDB and Cassandra featured prominently at the last one I attended, and SQLite was well represented at the first one.

Saturday and Sunday were breakfast, sessions, lunch (yum), and sessions and hacking. These were held at souk, a co-working space. After 5PM, people got together for dinner, beer, etc.
I presented on mk-query-digest &ndash; a live demo of features requested by the audience.
