        <span class="post-date">Thu, Oct 6, 2011</span>
        I&rsquo;ve been seeing a few occasions where Neil J. Gunther&rsquo;s Universal Scalability Law doesn&rsquo;t seem to model all of the important factors in a system as it scales. Models are only models, and they&rsquo;re not the whole truth, so they never match reality perfectly. But there appear to be a small number of cases where systems can actually scale a bit better than linearly over a portion of the domain, due to what I&rsquo;ve been calling an &ldquo;economy of scale.

        I thought that Postgres Open 2011 was very well done. I liked the content, the location, and most especially the atmosphere, which felt much more welcoming than some PostgreSQL conferences I&rsquo;ve attended. This last point bears repeating: I&rsquo;d exceeded my tolerance for trash talk about MySQL at other conferences, and this event made me feel valued again. I believe that the leaders and organizers set the tone, so I think that Selena and the committee deserve a lot of credit and thanks for the warm atmosphere.

I work for Percona, a MySQL consulting company. To augment my memory, I keep a quick-reference text file with notes on interesting issues that customers ask us to solve. One of the categories of frequent problems is attempts to build a job queue in MySQL. I have so many URLs under this bullet point that I stopped keeping track anymore. Customers have endless problems with job queues in their databases.

        PostgreSQL 9 Administration Cookbook. By Simon Riggs and Hannu Krosing, Packt, 2010. Approximately 330 pages.
This is a good book for PostgreSQL database administrators to pick up, especially if you&rsquo;re new to PostgreSQL but familiar with another system such as Oracle, SQL Server, or MySQL. It has more than 80 &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; that range from quick tips to moderately detailed discussion of how to accomplish specific tasks. The chapters and recipes are well organized, and you can either read the book from start to finish or jump to a specific recipe for quick help.

I enjoyed this book a lot and recommend it to everyone who uses PostgreSQL or MySQL. MySQL users should benefit from understanding PostgreSQL. Beyond that, I learned a lot from this book that I can apply directly to MySQL. In particular, the book begins with a few chapters on hardware performance, benchmarking, and configuration.

        I&rsquo;ll be presenting several sessions at the O&rsquo;Reilly MySQL Conference &amp; Expo 2011, which is April 11-14 in Santa Clara, California. I recommend this conference to anyone interested in open-source databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, CouchDB, MongoDB, and others. There is very good coverage of a diverse list of open-source databases.
My sessions are as follows:
 Building on Strengths, Learning from Differences: a keynote address on the open-source database ecosystem, how we got here, and what we can do to make the most of the future.

        I&rsquo;ve released version 1.1.8 of the Better Cacti Templates project. This release includes a bunch of bug fixes and several important new graphs. There are graphs for the new response-time statistics exposed in Percona Server, and a new set of graphs for MongoDB.
 VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti.

        One of the query optimization scenarios I&rsquo;ve seen a lot over the years is finding something within some distance from a point. For example, finding people within some distance of yourself, apartments in a radius from a postal code, and so on.
These queries usually use the great-circle formula. That might be because Google finds lots of pages claiming that this is the right way to do a radius search. &ldquo;The earth is not flat!

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 6, 2010</span>
        There have been a few great blog posts recently from MySQL bloggers about Postgres, and vice versa, with good comments and follow-on from the real experts in both systems. I think this is wonderful. Learning how other databases solve hard problems is highly educational, especially because ACID databases face some of the hardest problems in computing. Making MySQL better is good for PostgreSQL. The reverse is just as true. And we should also be learning from SQLite, and CouchDB, and others who have overcome tough technical hurdles, built successful companies, created thriving and enthusiastic communities, or whatever their success has been.

The last-minute proposals are coming fast and furious, as usual, and we have a great selection to choose from, but we need more!

        I wish I could go to PGWest this year. A lot of great work has been done on PostgreSQL in the last year and a half. There&rsquo;s a new release with built-in replication, and there are in-place upgrades. That solves two of what I think are its three biggest shortcomings in many large-scale database deployments. (Lack of index-only queries is the third shortcoming.)
PGWest is the first major conference about Postgres since the 9.

We&rsquo;re looking for a breadth as well as a depth of proposals on technologies beyond MySQL, and in the speaker selection committee conference calls, PostgreSQL was on the top of the list. I am on the committee. Your high-quality submissions will get a fair and unbiased vote from me, and I think I can speak for the rest of the committee too.

        Relational Database Index Design and the Optimizers. By Tapio Lahdenmaki and Mike Leach, Wiley 2005.
I picked this book up on the advice of an Oracle expert, and after one of my colleagues had read it and mentioned it to me. The focus is on how to design indexes that will produce the best performance for various types of queries. It goes into quite a bit of detail on how databases execute specific types of queries, including sort-merge joins and multiple index access, and develops a generic cost model that can be used to produce a quick upper-bound estimate (QUBE) for the execution time of a query.

        I just realized that I didn&rsquo;t publicize this in the Postgres world, or anywhere but the MySQL blogosphere for that matter. Some folks at my company have released a generic TCP-response-time tool. Very useful for monitoring, benchmarks, historical metrics, and so on. It&rsquo;s kind of like iostat, but for TCP traffic, and fully focused on time, not traffic size. Performance == time and tasks, and this is a lightweight way to measure that data.
