        <span class="post-date">Mon, May 25, 2015</span>
        <p>Many database vendors would like me to take a look at their products and
consider adopting them for all sorts of purposes. Often they&rsquo;re pitching
something quite new and unproven as a replacement for mature, boring technology
I&rsquo;m using happily.</p>

<p>I would consider a new and unproven technology, and I often have. As I&rsquo;ve
written previously, though, <a href="/blog/2014/06/08/time-series-database-requirements/">a real evaluation takes a lot of
effort</a>, and that
makes most evaluations non-starters.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important thing I&rsquo;m considering is whether the product is
mature. There are different levels of maturity, naturally, but I want to
understand whether it&rsquo;s mature enough for me to take a look at it. And in that
spirit, it&rsquo;s worth understanding what makes a database mature.</p>

        <p>This should sound familiar:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the great lies about NoSQL databases is that they&rsquo;re simple. Simplicity
done wrong makes things a lot harder and more complicated to develop and
operate. Programmers and operations staff end up reimplementing (badly) things
the database should do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody argued this line of reasoning more vigorously than when trying to defend
relational databases, especially during the darkest years (ca.  2009-2010), when
NoSQL still meant <strong>NO SQL DAMMIT</strong>, all sorts of NoSQL databases were
sprouting, and most of them were massively overhyped.  But as valid as those
arguments against NoSQL&rsquo;s &ldquo;false economy&rdquo; simplicity were and are, the arguments
against relational databases&rsquo; complexity hold true, too.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Dec 6, 2014</span>
        Do you use Google&rsquo;s Go language (golang)? Do you use a relational database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL with it? Do you want to learn how to?
Go has a package called database/sql for connecting to relational databases. There&rsquo;s package documentation, but you&rsquo;ll need to read the source code if you really want to understand how to use the package. The documentation doesn&rsquo;t really explain how to use the package, it just explains what it does.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Feb 26, 2014</span>
        <p>Sometimes people&rsquo;s perspective can be so interesting. I mean this with
absolutely no irony. Josh Berkus wrote recently in a post about upcoming <a href="http://www.databasesoup.com/2014/02/why-hstore2jsonb-is-most-important.html">JSON
improvements in PostgreSQL 9.4</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MySQL largely rose on the success of PHP, and it fell as PHP became
marginalized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an aside in the blog post, off-topic. But it&rsquo;s
interesting to discuss because it reveals the completely different things people
see when they look at something. It&rsquo;s like the proverbial story about the blind
men describing an elephant. We have such a variety of perceptions.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/02/kaleidoscope.jpg" alt="Elephant" /></p>

<p>This post, by the way, is not yet another flame war about MySQL versus
PostgreSQL. To the contrary, it is very important for MySQL users and
community members to understand that there are other communities who do not
share the same assumptions, values, and beliefs at all. In my experience, many
arguments about things like MySQL versus PostgreSQL result from people (or
groups of people) holding such differences but being unaware of them, and
therefore misinterpreting words and actions from a group who doesn&rsquo;t share the
same worldview, believing them to be dishonest, irrational, or hostile.</p>

        <p>Not long ago I attended a talk about Datomic, which focused a lot on database
immutability and its benefits. I hope to illustrate why many database designs
are much more complicated than Datomic and its ilk. Although Datomic&rsquo;s design
can be presented as <em>advanced</em>, there&rsquo;s another side to the story, which also
holds true for similar databases such as CouchDB. It&rsquo;s a really difficult
problem space, and clean and elegant solutions without nasty edge cases are
difficult to design and implement.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Sep 10, 2013</span>
        Continuing with my wishlist, I&rsquo;ll add windowing functions. They&rsquo;re enormously powerful. They allow you to extend relational logic beyond the strict boundaries of tuples. In MySQL at present, one must use ugly hacks to preserve state from one row to the next, such as user variables &ndash; which are not guaranteed to work if the optimizer changes the query plan.
And yeah, PostgreSQL and SQL Server have windowing functions too, and once you&rsquo;ve used them it&rsquo;s a little hard to go back.

        The pace of MySQL engineering has been pretty brisk for the last few years. I think that most of the credit is due to Oracle, but one should not ignore Percona, Monty Program, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and others. Not only are these organizations (and the individuals I haven&rsquo;t mentioned) innovating a lot, they&rsquo;re providing pressure on Oracle to keep up the improvements, too.
But if you look back over the last few years, MySQL is still functionally a lot like it used to be.

        Are you a Django user? There&rsquo;s an upcoming Django conference in Chicago in a few months, and I know they&rsquo;re looking for speakers with MySQL experience in particular. One suggestion the organizers have floated is a talk on MySQL:
 I&rsquo;m looking for someone to give at least one MySQL talk there. In particular, I would love a (friendly but vigorous) &ldquo;Why you should use MySQL instead of PostgreSQL talk&rdquo;, as PostgreSQL tends to get a lot of love and attention at Django events, and MySQL not so much.

        I was just bitten by failing to catch a MySQL warning. It&rsquo;s the old familiar tune: I inserted 100 characters into a VARCHAR(50) and it didn&rsquo;t throw an error*. Of course, then subsequent SELECT statements didn&rsquo;t find the value I inserted.
What&rsquo;s different this time is that I was using Go as the client. There is no single official MySQL driver for Go, although there are several good-quality community-maintained ones. I was using one of those through the official Go database interface, which is a simple and lightweight way to interact with relational databases.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Aug 23, 2012</span>
        Although not perfect, MySQL replication was probably the killer feature that made MySQL the default database for web applications some time ago. Since then, MySQL replication has been improved greatly, with such notable changes as row-based replication. At the same time, the replication engineering team has made MySQL replication more conservative and less forgiving of foot-gun errors. These have gone a long way towards helping users avoid some of the problems that made replication sometimes drift out of sync with the master copy, sometimes silently.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 9, 2012</span>
        MySQL became wildly successful in part because it had built-in, simple replication. Sure, it had lots of interesting failure scenarios and was not great at first &mdash; it is much better these days &mdash; but it was nevertheless successful because there was a single, out-of-the-box, not-very-complex way to do replication. I have opined many times before that this was one of the killer features missing from PostgreSQL. I think that can large explain why MySQL became more popular more quickly.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 19, 2011</span>
        Blackhole tables are often used on a so-called &ldquo;relay replica&rdquo; where some operation needs to happen but no data needs to exist. This used to have a bug that prevented AUTO_INCREMENT columns from propagating the right values through replication, but that was fixed. It turns out there&rsquo;s another bug, though, that has the same effect. This one is caused when there is an INSERT into a Blackhole table, where the source data is SELECT-ed from another Blackhole table.
