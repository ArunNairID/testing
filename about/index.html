<p>I am the founder of <a href="https://www.vividcortex.com/">VividCortex</a> and the lead author of <a href="http://www.highperfmysql.com/">High Performance MySQL</a>. I studied Computer Science at the University of Virginia, then worked at several technology companies. I spent the first decade of my career as a programmer, and created a lot of open-source software. My online nickname Xaprb is my first name Baron typed in QWERTY on a Dvorak keyboard layout.</p>

<p>You can contact me using my first name at VividCortex. You can also find me on
<a href="http://twitter.com/xaprb">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/xaprb">LinkedIn</a>,

<p>I&rsquo;m private about my personal life, but I try to be an open book about who I am.
I wrote this page to help you learn what makes me tick.</p>

<h3 id="my-personality-and-behaviors">My Personality and Behaviors</h3>

<p>Personality assessments are a useful tool for describing my style.
Using the DISC model of personality, I&rsquo;m a DC.  When plotted in a DISC wheel,
I&rsquo;m a Conducting Implementor.</p>

<p><img src="/media/disc-wheel.png" alt="DISC" /></p>

<p>In plain English, my strongest behaviors are:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m focused, steady, calm, patient, and agreeable.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m task-focused, results-focused, fast-moving, and urgent.</li>
<li>I value my time highly and manage it carefully.</li>
<li>I take responsibilities seriously and expect others to do the same.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m independent, assertive, demanding, and comfortable with risk.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m ambitious, determined, persistent, and competitive; I love winning and dislike losing.</li>
<li>My communication style is direct, to-the-point, and can be blunt; I&rsquo;m not very diplomatic.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m skeptical, perfectionist, and detail-oriented. I find typos.</li>
<li>I value clear and concise communication. I dislike fluff and ambiguity.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m creative, visionary, futuristic, and forward-looking.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m objective, logical, analytical, technical, and data-driven.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m reserved and introverted. I&rsquo;m not a hugger except with family and close
friends. I don&rsquo;t project emotion and can appear aloof.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m understated and guarded, and prefer to observe rather than
being the center of attention.</li>
<li>You won&rsquo;t think I am much fun till you know me well, but I have a slapstick
sense of humor.</li>
</ul>

<p>People usually experience me as supportive, attentive, active, engaged,
decisive, and motivating. You might find my passion and drive compelling.  When
I&rsquo;m under stress, you might feel that I&rsquo;m abrasive and controlling. At my worst,
I can be a pushy perfectionist, and you might feel that I demand too much too
fast.</p>

<h3 id="my-driving-forces">My Driving Forces</h3>

<p>The next layer of the onion is my inner motivations&mdash;what I value and
what drives my decisions and behaviors. Here are my scores on Eduard Spranger&rsquo;s
model of hidden motivators:</p>

<p><img src="/media/driving-forces.png" alt="Driving Forces" /></p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an interpretation of that chart in my own words, keyed off the name shown
above the centerline of each spectrum:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Knowledge</strong>: I am highly theoretical, driven to research, understand, and
discover truth. I&rsquo;m insatiably curious. I am skeptical of intuition and rarely
rely on gut feeling alone. If I visit your house, I&rsquo;ll look at the titles on
your bookshelf before I look at the family photos on your wall.</li>
<li><strong>Utility</strong>: I do things with an outcome in mind, rather than for the greater
good, the cause, or the sake of doing. Money is rarely my motivator; I care
more about impact and results.  I look for group wins as well as individual
contributions.</li>
<li><strong>Surroundings</strong>: I&rsquo;m a detail-oriented big-picture thinker. I value great
design, simplicity, and function over form. I see the trees before the forest,
and I might emphasize one or the other situationally. I love music, art, and
poetry, but I don&rsquo;t always take the time to create beauty in my surroundings.
I function well in chaos, and I think conflict is productive, but I will try
to create order. I value quality craftsmanship, but I&rsquo;m happy with a good
bargain. I embrace Wabi-sabi. I don&rsquo;t emphasize my appearance, and tend to dress simply.</li>
<li><strong>Others</strong>: I recognize and value people&rsquo;s individuality, but I generally help
people for a specific purpose, rather than for the satisfaction of being
supportive. I believe everyone should contribute to the best of their ability.
Because of my substantial Selfless and Harmonious motivations, I don&rsquo;t think
it&rsquo;s a win if anyone is left out, and I&rsquo;ll champion those who need protection.</li>
<li><strong>Power</strong>: In most situations I am comfortable taking charge, especially when
I see that it&rsquo;s needed. I don&rsquo;t need public recognition, and I direct for the
sake of achieving results, rather than for power, political reasons, or
self-esteem.</li>
<li><strong>Methodologies</strong>: I interpret traditions flexibly and I don&rsquo;t feel bound by
the way things have always been done. I do not need external guidance or
organizational structure to give me direction or standards; I set my own. I
seek input from others, but I form opinions independently. I&rsquo;ll check if a
process exists before I invent a new one. I have an ever-changing system for
living and I think outside the box to find the best way to approach each
individual situation. I live by the motto &ldquo;strong opinions loosely held.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p>The only dimension where I&rsquo;m outside the norm is Intentional. Thus, you are
unlikely to find me too extreme in my views, but if you are extremely
Altruistic, you might feel I&rsquo;m not caring enough. I do care, but as a CEO I have
to balance my caring with a business focus.</p>

<h3 id="advice-for-communicating-with-me">Advice For Communicating With Me</h3>

<p>Here are some things to keep in mind when approaching me.</p>

<ul>
<li>Be clear, brief, and concise.</li>
<li>Begin with your conclusions or recommendations (don&rsquo;t begin with facts and
build to conclusions). Be prepared to support and explain your reasoning and
data, but let me ask for the details if I want them.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t leave things open-ended, ramble, or make non-specific requests. Have a
clear &ldquo;ask,&rdquo; and clear next steps and action items to achieve a specific
outcome.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t forget things or rely on me to set the agenda. Always follow up and
follow through. Send spell-checked materials in advance.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t try to pressure or dominate me. Don&rsquo;t expect people&rsquo;s opinions of me to
influence me.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t exaggerate, speculate, or make statements you can&rsquo;t prove.</li>
<li>Avoid melodrama, appealing to my self-interests, or anything that could feel
manipulative, such as quid-pro-quo, flattery, name-dropping, or buzzwords.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t touch me or get too close to me.</li>
<li>Stick to business instead of talking about my weekend plans or my family,
unless we&rsquo;re close friends or I signal that I&rsquo;m in a mood to engage socially.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-understand-my-unique-perspectives">How To Understand My Unique Perspectives</h3>

<p>In my experience with hundreds of personality assessments, few people (perhaps 1 in 20) fall in the top center of the DISC wheel where I am, so you
might not interact with people similar to me very often.  As such, I might
behave in surprising or seemingly contradictory ways, or send mixed signals.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s usually a logic behind it, and I&rsquo;m rarely arbitrary or haphazard. Here&rsquo;s how to interpret and work with some of my characteristics you might experience as odd or unexpected:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Supportive but unemotional.</strong> I&rsquo;m basically introverted.  I value actions
more highly than words or body language, so I&rsquo;m often undemonstrative and you
might feel that I am situationally empathetic at best, even if you&rsquo;re part of
my inner circle of close associates. In truth, I care deeply for people.  I&rsquo;m
fiercely loyal and supportive, and I&rsquo;ll fight hard for people after I reach a
certain level of trust with them.</li>
<li><strong>Audacious but cautious.</strong> Given time, I prefer to be data-driven, but I
sometimes make quick judgments without explaining all of the reasoning. This
can seem rash, but I&rsquo;m usually pursuing a specific goal, such as optimizing
for learning or trying to eliminate dead ends quickly. My boldness isn&rsquo;t
reckless.  I want everyone who works with me to be biased to action, avoiding
analysis paralysis.  I like the phrase &ldquo;a fast B grade is better than a slow
A,&rdquo; or perhaps better yet &ldquo;done is better than perfect, so if it&rsquo;s worth
doing, it&rsquo;s worth doing badly.&rdquo; A lot of my worldview is included in that
counterintuitive phrase, which I like to think has a lot of value beneath the
surface.</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent but not eloquent.</strong> When I&rsquo;m trying to collect more data and
express myself at the same time, I sometimes stumble over my words. This can
make me seem hesitant or uncertain, especially when I&rsquo;m speaking without
preparation or trying to understand someone&rsquo;s point of view. I appreciate you
helping me with prompts, echoing back in your own words what you think I&rsquo;m
trying to say, or simply being patient with me.</li>
<li><strong>Visionary but visionary.</strong> I sometimes describe the future without laying
out a specific path to achieve it. I may jump around mentally and verbally,
leaving thoughts unfinished in my excitement. I may not be aware when you
don&rsquo;t see my vision clearly, or aren&rsquo;t clear on the steps to reach it.  It&rsquo;s a
good idea to make sure I know if this is the case. Ask me to connect the dots
for you.</li>
<li><strong>Easy-going but determined.</strong> According to the personality assessment, my
&ldquo;quiet demeanor conceals deeply held convictions,&rdquo; and I find that very
accurate. In practice, it means that you might misinterpret my agreeable
manner as submissiveness or lack of opinion, especially if you are a high DI
(you fall in the Conductor or Persuader quadrants of the DISC wheel). When I
feel that people don&rsquo;t take me seriously unless I&rsquo;m raising my voice, or that
they feel they have the upper hand by force of personality alone, I feel
disrespected, and that can lead to clashes. It&rsquo;s something to be aware of, for
me and you both.</li>
<li><strong>Demanding but methodical.</strong> Because I move fast and challenge people, you
might wonder if I give people enough chances. I might not tell you the private
details, but my decisions about others aren&rsquo;t arbitrary, and I practice
no-surprises leadership. If I&rsquo;m unsatisfied with your work, I&rsquo;ll tell you
directly, and I&rsquo;m very open about it. But because I don&rsquo;t look for external
validation, I don&rsquo;t naturally think to give overtly positive feedback to
others. I&rsquo;d like to improve at that, so please prompt me if you feel
comfortable doing so.</li>
<li><strong>Detailed but minimalist.</strong> Because I am data-driven and perfectionist, I
strive for simplicity so I can keep my mind clear and undistracted. I like
systems to be explained and governed by elegant, predictable models and rules.
I will challenge complicated spreadsheets, algorithms, or agreements and ask
if they can be simpler and clearer.</li>
<li><strong>Open-minded but independent.</strong> I don&rsquo;t really value other people&rsquo;s opinions
or judgments of me, but I value the information they can give me, so I&rsquo;m
happy&mdash;even eager&mdash;to get outside perspectives and observations. I learn the
most from people who disagree with me.  I suspend my beliefs, ask questions to
draw out their views, take what I like and leave the rest, and even play
devil&rsquo;s advocate against myself.  This can disturb some people, because it
looks like I am rudderless and lack self-confidence.  It&rsquo;s true that I move
the rudder freely, because it is not the rudder that guides me; it is my
personal North Star. And it is self-acceptance, not self-confidence, that
enables me to release doubts and act swiftly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please feel free to give me feedback that will help me learn more about myself!
It&rsquo;s OK to be very direct about this; you won&rsquo;t hurt my feelings. (See above.)</p>
