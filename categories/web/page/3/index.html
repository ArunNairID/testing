        View the Demo You&rsquo;ve probably heard of unobtrusive JavaScript. It&rsquo;s a simple technique that lets you create richer documents without cluttered markup or accessibility problems. I often see link decoration and drop-shadow effects done with unobtrusive JavaScript. How about unobtrusive image captions? Instead of writing a caption into the page, let JavaScript do it. In this article I&rsquo;ll show you how simple this can be.
The idea How often have you seen websites that use a table or a div to enclose an image and some text to create a &ldquo;captioned&rdquo; image?

I&rsquo;m going to finish and publish some of the drafts I have on the Web before I continue with another massive database marathon.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Aug 30, 2006</span>
        Microformats are getting some attention from the group of people who are clueful about the semantic web, but some people are not yet convinced they&rsquo;re useful. While microformats aren&rsquo;t as robust and complex as some more fully-featured technologies, some apparent limitations are actually possible to overcome, but with different methods than might be expected. In this article I&rsquo;ll address some common concerns about microformats, and explain how they are either solvable or already solved.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Jun 2, 2006</span>
        There&rsquo;s been much discussion about canonicalizing URIs for search engines and other purposes. Here&rsquo;s a possibility: instead of specifying the exact canonical URI for a page, just indicate which parts of it are important.
The issue usually comes up with regards to product pages in e-commerce, for example. Many e-commerce sites use query strings to specify the product to display. This is not a problem, because search engines like Google usually pay attention to several query string parameters.

        I want to follow up on my earlier article about how to do CAPTCHAs without images, for accessibility and usability. In that article I hoped my simple scheme would deter dumb robots, cutting down on the bulk of the comment spam I was getting.
It did cut out the comment spam &ndash; for a while. After a while, though, I started to get some spam again. I could see the spammer was either doing it manually, or had figured out that my form submission included the ID of the question I&rsquo;d asked (wow, you spammers sure are smart).

        This is the second article in a two-part series on understanding and using advanced features in HTML tables. In the first part I explained a few of the simpler features. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain how the axis attribute allows an author to encode multi-dimensional data into two-dimensional tables, and to encode relational data into hierarchical tables.
Encoding multiple dimensions There are lots of places where data has more than two dimensions &ndash; or where I might want to break data apart into more than two dimensions.

In this series I discuss the seldom-used features many people don&rsquo;t know exist in HTML tables, such as axes and the headers attribute. These are the tools you need to really use tables to their full power, instead of shoving some square-peg data into a round-hole table. Granted, many times you don&rsquo;t need these features, but when you do, they&rsquo;re like the &ldquo;ludicrous speed&rdquo; lever on your spaceship: nothing else will do.

        I wrote previously about IE blog&rsquo;s excellent quality. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s bad news to report, too. I&rsquo;ve been noticing some trends in web design blogs. Many have a similar style to glamour magazines. While many elements of glamour magazines are not echoed in these blogs, to the extent they are, I think it detracts from them quite a bit.

        Have you noticed how consistent the terminology, tone and style are on the IE blog? Clearly, a lot of work is going into making this blog as good as possible at promoting the work the IE team is doing on the new browser. It remains to be seen how the browser itself evolves, but I think there is a lot to learn from studying the IE blog.
First, it looks to me as though Microsoft have carefully chosen a message, purpose and style for the blog&rsquo;s articles.

        I&rsquo;ve started getting a lot of spam comments, so I decided the time has come to put a simple system in place to foil the spam robots. In an earlier article I asserted CAPTCHAs are terrible and there are easy ways to foil naive robots without making the site inaccessible or unusable. I&rsquo;ve implemented a simple question-and-answer system to prove my point. Comment forms show a randomly chosen predefined question (I&rsquo;ve only put three in the system) and display several predefined answers, only one of which is correct.

        I have created a web page that matches regular expressions against arbitrary input text and displays the results graphically, so you can take some sample text and build regular expressions the easy way, with immediate feedback about what matches and where, where you have errors, and more.
I&rsquo;ve been working on this for a couple of weeks, a minute here and there as I get time. A few days ago I saw someone created a very nifty similar app over at Rex V.

        IE6, Firefox 1.5 and Opera 8.5 handle regular expressions slightly differently. I analyzed them and learned some interesting things about the browsers. For this article, I&rsquo;m using abcde as the input, and /abc|d(e)/g as the regular expression. The expression should match twice, and the second match should capture the letter &ldquo;e&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s in a capturing subexpression.
Properties of match results Calling RegExp.prototype.exec() with a global regular expression returns an Array object with some extra properties.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 10, 2006</span>
        XHTML tables provide several elements to group and structure data, including row groups (thead, tbody, and tfoot). Styling row groups with CSS can make data relationships visually obvious. One familiar way to group data visually is with Explorer-style folder icons.
The basic idea is to use tbody as many times as needed to group each set of rows together. The image above shows a single tbody element. I think using multiple tbody elements may not occur to developers because it sounds like there ought to be only one &ndash; but that&rsquo;s not true.

        This article continues my series on parsing and formatting data with JavaScript, this time with numeric data. I don&rsquo;t need to do number parsing, but formatting is very useful. The technique is similar to my date formatting code &ndash; code that writes code (for raw speed), using custom format specifier strings (for flexibility and ease of use). The result is number formatting functionality that is highly efficient, flexible, and easy to use.

        I don&rsquo;t know how spreadsheets do it internally, but at least from a user&rsquo;s perspective, they derive the default cell format from the type of data in the cell. For example, if I enter a number into a cell, the spreadsheet will right-align it. It will format dates and times according to cultural conventions, and will recognize other data types as well. This is the right way to do it, because the formatting conveys information about the data.

Specifically, I used char as a variable name, and no Windows browser had a problem with it &ndash; but when I tested on Mac, both Safari and Firefox complained. Apparently there are differences in JavaScript implementation between the Windows and Mac versions of Firefox 1.5!
