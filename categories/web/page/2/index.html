        <span class="post-date">Sun, Jun 21, 2009</span>
        I&rsquo;m using Google Docs for a project I&rsquo;m working on right now, and I ran into a problem with spacing. There appears to be no way to get spacing between paragraphs. You can control spacing between lines, but that&rsquo;s not the same thing. Actually, it&rsquo;s quite easy. You just have to know how Google Docs works.
The root problem is that it&rsquo;s not creating paragraphs when you press the [Enter] key.

        I really like Dokuwiki. I remember looking at it many years ago (even then, there were way too many wikis) but for some reason my company or project at the time didn&rsquo;t choose it. Maybe this was the company that decided Sharepoint was better, I don&rsquo;t remember. (They never did understand why a collection of Word documents was inferior to a wiki.)
I&rsquo;ve been using it for a while now, and of all the wikis I&rsquo;ve used, which are quite a few, it is easily the nicest.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Mar 7, 2009</span>
        A while ago I switched my theme to Journalist (link at the very bottom of the page) because I thought it was well laid out and solidly designed &ndash; I mean it uses sensible CSS and XHTML etc. The only thing I didn&rsquo;t care for was that it was a little too minimal, if anything. There are lots of themes out there that look gorgeous, but when I tested them they don&rsquo;t render right.

        My employer has been looking for a company who can provide us with phone service designed for a decentralized, virtual-office consulting and support workforce, and after extensive surveying of the options, every single one comes up short on features, quality, or support. You can have one or sometimes two, but not all three, and we don&rsquo;t really see signs of it getting better. There&rsquo;s a real race to the bottom in this industry.

        Sourceforge has reintroduced persistent login cookies. Here&rsquo;s the bug request I submitted about this, a long time ago.
The thing is, I don&rsquo;t really care much anymore. I&rsquo;ve moved my open-source projects off Sourceforge onto Google Code. I am about 10x more productive there.
This lesson can be applied to pretty much everything on the web these days. Make it even the slightest bit hard to use your service, and people will use what&rsquo;s easy instead.

        I wanted to make readers who are web designers aware of a new resource for learning about raw performance (page load time and render time). This is the Web Scaling Blog, a blog my employer started a while ago and didn&rsquo;t really update, but which is now starting to get some in-depth content thanks to a very smart colleague of mine, Nail Kashapov. There are a lot of practical, real-world examples of how you can dig deep into front-end performance and make your site really load fast.

        It&rsquo;s been a while since I have updated my JavaScript formatting and parsing functions, and people have been posting comments on them. Unfortunately my interests have really turned elsewhere, and I&rsquo;m not much in the world of frontend web design anymore. There&rsquo;s good news though: now I&rsquo;ve made it easy for you to get the code, change the code, document it, report issues on it, and so forth. I&rsquo;ve hosted the code at Google Code.

        It has all played itself out according to Microsoft&rsquo;s wishes. They have railroaded through a so-called standard for document representation, gotten it rubber-stamped by so-called standards bodies, and fought their way past all the objections of sensible people and companies. In the process, lots of developing nations have been steamrolled, too. Shame, shame, shame.

        I just finished reading Building Powerful and Robust Websites with Drupal 6 (this title on Packt&rsquo;s site). I&rsquo;ve been working on a website powered by Drupal, and though it was obvious that Drupal is very flexible and capable, I was getting pretty lost in the website. So I wanted to read a book that would explain it to me.
Unfortunately, this book didn&rsquo;t help me much. I&rsquo;d give it 2 out of 5 stars.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Mar 27, 2008</span>
        I have an ingrained (possibly even genetic) aversion to stock images. Actually, not all stock: just the vacuous kind. You know what I mean: like the politically-correct, gender-balanced, racially-balanced, age-diverse ones where people are all smiling and pointing at a computer screen you can&rsquo;t see. Ugh!
(Photo credit: istockphoto.com)
There are many reasons not to use images like this. I guess it&rsquo;s okay in some situations &ndash; for example when you just want a smiling, attractive woman with a customer-service headset to reinforce that you&rsquo;ve come to the right place for support.

        My wife has a site that needs two WordPress blog installations. The URLs differ by a subdirectory name. Both blogs need to be (URL-wise) subdirectories of /blog/. They need to be completely independent of each other, yet use the same custom theme. And there used to be just a single blog, which was not in a subdirectory; its permalinks must not break. (It has nice URLs with the date and title in them, not post ID-style URLs).

        To cut down on comment spam, I have Bad Behavior enabled on this blog, and there was a minor issue with the version I had, though in general it has been wonderful. My apologies if it blocked you. I didn&rsquo;t get any email from folks saying they were blocked, but it blocked me! Apparently a fairly common complaint. I&rsquo;ve upgraded now and I&rsquo;m not seeing any more issues.
There&rsquo;s a lot of hate mail towards Bad Behavior&rsquo;s author because of this, so I want to try to cancel some of that out: this plugin has saved me many gray hairs.

 Number.prototype.NaN Number.prototype.posInfinity Number.prototype.negInfinity  For more documentation, see the original article on JavaScript number formatting.

        This is a quick update on the state of my JavaScript date formatting libraries and date chooser, and JavaScript number formatting library. It&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote them, and as you can tell my interests have turned to many other things, but thet remain the best JavaScript formatting and parsing libraries I&rsquo;ve seen.
I originally started this post in May of 2006, intending to use the libraries to demonstrate how HTML tables can contain multi-dimensional data, and use the seldom-used HTML elements like TFOOT to generate aggregate data about the table.

        I&rsquo;ve released a new version of my powerful, flexible, efficient JavaScript number-formatting library, which is probably the best available. This release adds a fix for zero-padding negative numbers.
If you find bugs, please send me test cases I can use to reproduce and add to the unit test suite. One test per line, like &ldquo;input&rdquo;, &ldquo;format&rdquo;, &ldquo;expected&rdquo; is best. For example, this is a great test case:
-1, "#,#.00", "-1.00" I can plug that directly into the unit test suite, run it, and if it gives back &ldquo;-01.

        I wrote a custom image-less CAPTCHA for my blog a while ago. I didn&rsquo;t write it as a plugin, so I lost it when I upgraded WordPress a couple weeks ago. Not having this protection was an eye-opening experience, and vindicated what I asserted in my original posts: a naive question-and-answer system is highly effective at stopping spammers, probably as effective as scrambled images. Read on for the details.

This is often useful on shared hosting providers, where you can&rsquo;t get C extensions installed. The library uses PHP4&#8242;s built-in SAX functions, which are enabled by default. Today I&rsquo;m re-releasing this library under the LGPL (EDIT: later re-released under MIT). You can find it here
