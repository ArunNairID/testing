        <p>Dear Reader,</p>

<p>Hi! I probably don&rsquo;t know you, but I&rsquo;d like to make this blog better for you. If
you&rsquo;re disabled&mdash;for example, perhaps you use a screen reader, a special
device, or have other needs that I might not anticipate, I&rsquo;d really love your
feedback on what I can do to make my content easier for you to read and enjoy.</p>

        I&rsquo;ve switched this blog from Wordpress to Hugo. If you see any broken links or other problems, let me know. I&rsquo;ll re-enable comments and other features in the coming days.
Why not Wordpress? I&rsquo;ve used Wordpress since very early days, but I&rsquo;ve had my fill of security problems, the need to worry about whether a database is up and available, backups, plugin compatibility problems, upgrades, and performance issues. In fact, while converting the content from Wordpress to Markdown, I found a half-dozen pages that had been hacked by some link-farm since around 2007.

        I&rsquo;m looking for a freelancer to convert this WordPress blog into Markdown for use with Octopress. It should be straightforward &ndash; I have already used a plugin to export the data as Markdown. However, a few extra things will need to be taken care of. I have posted this job on Elance. Please submit proposals there!

        I&rsquo;m not using my previous combination of Bad Behaviour + WP-Gatekeeper anymore. I&rsquo;ve removed them in favor of ordinary reCAPTCHA. Although it lets a lot of spammers through (almost a thousand spam comments in the day I&rsquo;ve had it enabled) and Bad Behaviour let only 1 or 2 a month through, it became clear that a lot of people were getting blocked wrongly by Bad Behaviour.
This means that I can&rsquo;t practically moderate the spam queue.

        Someone&rsquo;s testing my blog recently, trying by hand to get comments through my spam blockers. They&rsquo;re trying by hand because automated attempts are blocked and the server simply doesn&rsquo;t respond. Hand-submitting spam doesn&rsquo;t scale, so only a few have popped up on my admin screen.
Have fun, I.P. addresses 173.213.212.234 and 219.91.208.244 (remember the Internet isn&rsquo;t anonymous). If you look around this blog you won&rsquo;t notice any spam comments. There&rsquo;s a reason for that &ndash; a combination of reasons, actually.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, May 3, 2012</span>
        I got a really intriguing email today. As you might imagine, I get a lot of email offering to advertise, or trade links, or guest post, etc etc. But this is the most compelling one I&rsquo;ve ever gotten:
 I came across your blog /blog/2009/03/13/50-things-to-know-before-migrating-oracle-to-mysql/ a few weeks ago as while conducting research for a website that I contribute to. The website aims to look at the progressive areas of early childhood psychology.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Mar 7, 2009</span>
        A while ago I switched my theme to Journalist (link at the very bottom of the page) because I thought it was well laid out and solidly designed &ndash; I mean it uses sensible CSS and XHTML etc. The only thing I didn&rsquo;t care for was that it was a little too minimal, if anything. There are lots of themes out there that look gorgeous, but when I tested them they don&rsquo;t render right.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, May 21, 2008</span>
        Did you notice that I moved this blog from pair Networks to pairLite hosting?
Probably not, unless you check the DNS of xaprb.com regularly!
Don&rsquo;t you hate it when people say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m moving my blog, I hope there won&rsquo;t be more than a few days of downtime, blah blah&hellip;&rdquo; Why is this ever necessary, I wonder? I wonder the same thing about a lot of hosting providers &ndash; recently I had a client in my consulting practice whose (very large, well-known) hosting provider tried to help them with some very simple MySQL work and ended up causing them an obscene amount of downtime, like many many days, and there was no end in sight.

        Effective April 1, I will join Percona full-time as a consultant. I&rsquo;ll be helping people build high-performance applications with MySQL, but I&rsquo;ll also be continuing to develop and improve tools such as Maatkit.
This career change has been a long time in progress. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to it, but at the same time it&rsquo;s hard to leave my current employer, The Rimm-Kaufman Group (RKG). Working with them has been the best job I&rsquo;ve ever had.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jul 10, 2007</span>
        I haven&rsquo;t been blogging about the things I used to &ndash; how-tos and technical hacks &ndash; because I&rsquo;ve been working quite hard on MySQL Toolkit and, believe it or not, innotop. I&rsquo;ve made it possible to write innotop plugins, which have been very useful to our team at work, and I&rsquo;m working on documentation. Plugins won&rsquo;t make it into the upcoming release; it&rsquo;ll just be bug fixes and documentation. These projects have taken up most of my free time.

        The 9rules network, a trusted filter that chooses the best content on the web, has named Xaprb as a featured blog. This means a lot to me. 9rules is a great place to go and find quality content on an Internet that&rsquo;s drowning in garbage, so being featured there is no small matter.
This is a good time for to make a plug for 9rules, too. One great way to stay up-to-date on the best of the web is browse the communities and find one that has interesting content, then subscribe to the aggregated feed.

        Xaprb is now part of the 9rules network. It&rsquo;s an honor and a pleasure. The best part is what Mr. Scrivens said about me:
 &hellip;the type of guy I would set next to in Calc class and watch him hacking the hell out of his TI calculator&hellip;
 My friends got quite a kick out of that. So did I, actually. Even being accepted to the network is a nice compliment, but this made me grin a big grin.
