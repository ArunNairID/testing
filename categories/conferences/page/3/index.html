        <span class="post-date">Wed, Feb 23, 2011</span>
        The call for papers for the MySQL conference&rsquo;s Ignite sessions is open. These are a lot of fun: 5 minutes, 20 slides, period. Last year I spoke way too fast &ndash; if I do it again this year, I&rsquo;ll try not to cram so much into so little time. Either that, or I&rsquo;ll deliberately talk like Busta Rhymes.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 29, 2011</span>
        I&rsquo;ll be presenting several sessions at the O&rsquo;Reilly MySQL Conference &amp; Expo 2011, which is April 11-14 in Santa Clara, California. I recommend this conference to anyone interested in open-source databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, CouchDB, MongoDB, and others. There is very good coverage of a diverse list of open-source databases.
My sessions are as follows:
 Building on Strengths, Learning from Differences: a keynote address on the open-source database ecosystem, how we got here, and what we can do to make the most of the future.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Jan 13, 2011</span>
        I wish I could be at this: Percona Live San Francisco. It is on February 16th. Cost is minimal, and content is maximal. The topic is on what&rsquo;s new in MySQL these days beyond 5.1: the new 5.5 release, HandlerSocket, MariaDB, and of course Percona Server.
This is a follow-up to the enormously successful Percona Performance Conference in 2009.

        This looks like fun: Ruby on Ales. It&rsquo;s March 24-25, 2011 in Bend Oregon (USA), and the tag line is Ruby, snow, and beer. Does it get any better than this?

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Dec 19, 2010</span>
        O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s 2011 edition of the MySQL conference has an expanded agenda, with good representation from Postgres, CouchDB, MongoDB, and others. Take a look at the full schedule listing, which is being filled out as talks are approved and the speakers verify that they&rsquo;ll give the session.
I am certainly looking forward to this year&rsquo;s event. A tremendous amount of progress has landed in GA versions of open-source databases this year. To name just a couple, there&rsquo;s a new version of Postgres (9.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Oct 25, 2010</span>
        You have about 14 more hours to submit session proposals to the O&rsquo;Reilly MySQL conference, which is soliciting sessions about all open-source databases: PostgreSQL, CouchDB, Riak, Hadoop, Firebird, you name it. The last-minute proposals are coming fast and furious, as usual, and we have a great selection to choose from, but we need more!

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Oct 19, 2010</span>
        I wish I could go to PGWest this year. A lot of great work has been done on PostgreSQL in the last year and a half. There&rsquo;s a new release with built-in replication, and there are in-place upgrades. That solves two of what I think are its three biggest shortcomings in many large-scale database deployments. (Lack of index-only queries is the third shortcoming.)
PGWest is the first major conference about Postgres since the 9.

        I&rsquo;ve written before about how to get accepted to the conference. We want great technical submissions in a broad variety of topics, for databases well beyond MySQL. I wanted to post a quick list of things that come to my mind as good ways to get voted down or rejected out of hand. In general, I can put it this way: you are being peer-reviewed by presenters and industry experts. You need to write your proposal for the committee as well as for attendees.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Sep 29, 2010</span>
        Some people seem unclear about whether there will be a 2011 MySQL conference from O&rsquo;Reilly. There most definitely will be, and the CfP is open. We are looking for speakers. I&rsquo;m on the speaker selection committee again this year for the Nth time, and my advice from past years still stands. This year we&rsquo;re also looking for a greater diversity of database products, including other relational databases, NoSQL databases, and ancillary technologies.

        I&rsquo;d like to encourage everyone in the Postgres world to submit session proposals to the 2011 O&rsquo;Reilly MySQL conference. It&rsquo;ll be a different event this year. We&rsquo;re looking for a breadth as well as a depth of proposals on technologies beyond MySQL, and in the speaker selection committee conference calls, PostgreSQL was on the top of the list. I am on the committee. Your high-quality submissions will get a fair and unbiased vote from me, and I think I can speak for the rest of the committee too.

        ODTUG invited me to give a webinar and I said yes, so this Thursday you&rsquo;re invited to join me as I talk about MySQL performance. We&rsquo;ve come a very long way towards a MySQL that can perform well on modern hardware, and there really isn&rsquo;t broad recognition of this. A lot of the best work has gone into the InnoDB &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; storage engine, which was announced after my co-authors and I sent High Performance MySQL to the press.

        The closest thing I know of to a &ldquo;Northern Virginia MySQL Meetup&rdquo; is the Sterling Database Data Solutions Group. I got in touch with the organizer and we scheduled a meeting next Wednesday July 28th. I&rsquo;ll be presenting, and so will someone from Fusion-IO, a solid-state storage vendor. This is on short notice, so tell your friends about it! It would be great to grow a strong monthly meetup presence in this area.

        OmniTI&rsquo;s Surge conference is looking really good &ndash; and I&rsquo;m going to be speaking there. The CfP just closed, so the list of speakers is still growing, but it already includes impressive names such as Neil J. Gunther. So far, this speaker list has zero fluff, and reminds me of the Percona Performance Conference. I&rsquo;ll be talking about how not to shard your systems. Sharding is no fun and it&rsquo;s costly.

        In addition to the Boston edition, there&rsquo;s an OpenSQL Camp at the same time and place as FrOSCon mid-August in Germany. The call for papers is open until July 11th. As always, the conference is about all kinds of open-source databases: MySQL and PostgreSQL are only two of the obvious ones; MongoDB and Cassandra featured prominently at the last one I attended, and SQLite was well represented at the first one.

        Dr. Richard Hipp gave a talk at Southeast Linux Fest today on choosing an open-source database. He thinks that NoSQL is not a very good name for the new databases we&rsquo;re seeing these days, so he proposed a new name: postmodern databases. Why postmodern?
 The absence of objective truth Queries return opinions, not facts  I thought this was the best proposal I&rsquo;ve heard for an alternative to the NoSQL moniker.

Richard Hipp (SQLite), and yes, yours truly (MySQL), plus a MySQL name that&rsquo;s new to me: Brandon Checketts. There are a ton of non-database sessions too! Check out the full speaker &#038; session list. This was a great show last year; I highly encourage everyone to attend.

Matt Yonkovit will be there representing Percona. I wish I could go: I would really like to mingle with more Oracle users and developers, and I think that participation is the key to building relationships between MySQL and Oracle users &ndash; two groups of people who are going to be overlapping more in the future.
