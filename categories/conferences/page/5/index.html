        <span class="post-date">Thu, Aug 13, 2009</span>
        I&rsquo;m going to present at the EdUIConf conference 2009. This is a conference focused in two directions: Web professionals in higher education, and higher education for web professionals. I believe it&rsquo;s going to be comparable to, or at least in the same vein as, some of the more popular conferences about user interface design, Web standards, and the like. (It&rsquo;ll also be much more affordable.)
The speaker lineup boasts a number of heavy hitters.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Jun 29, 2009</span>
        I&rsquo;ll be attending the IT Management Conference later this year in New York. My proposals weren&rsquo;t chosen so I won&rsquo;t be speaking, but I wanted to attend whether I&rsquo;m speaking or not. It should be a very useful conference for those in or near management or leadership positions. Email me if you want a $50 discount off the registration, by the way.
PS: .me is a new top-level domain? Ugh, when will it end.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Jun 21, 2009</span>
        Last weekend, my brother and I attended SELF 2009. A few thoughts on it:
The mixture of sessions was interesting. There were some really good ones. I think the best session I attended was an OpenSolaris/NetBeans/Glassfish/Virtualbox/ZFS session, given by a Sun employee. He was an excellent presenter, and really showed off the strengths of the technologies in a nice way. He started up enough VMs to make his OpenSolaris laptop chew into swap, and I thought it was fun to see how it dealt with that.

        The slides for my session on Maatkit at the MySQL Conference are uploaded. They should appear on the speaker presentation files page, but I have heard that it can take a few days. Please let me know if they&rsquo;re not there by May 1, 2009.
I did not have time to plow through everything in the slides. (I deliberately prepared more material than I could cover, and just stopped when I ran out of time.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Apr 25, 2009</span>
        MySQL 5.4 was released this week at the MySQL conference, and billed as the &ldquo;community release.&rdquo; This seemed odd to some of us, and I heard lots of comment on it in the hallways. After all, the release was a surprise; the community didn&rsquo;t know it was happening.
A source from within Sun, who is familiar with the details and wishes to remain anonymous, told me the story behind the release.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Apr 25, 2009</span>
        As you may have noticed, Calpont has been advertising themselves as an open-source storage engine for MySQL. And yet there is no source code.
A bit of back-story. When we were choosing speakers for the Percona Performance Conference, I personally reviewed Calpont&rsquo;s submission and sent them an email on March 19th:
 I cannot confirm that this is an open-source columnar storage engine. I can&rsquo;t find source code or a download of the software.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Apr 21, 2009</span>
        This morning&rsquo;s MySQL Conference keynotes had a number of inaccuracies, but one that I wish to point out is the characterizations of Drizzle. It looks to me like some Sun/Oracle/MySQL folks are trying to take credit, now that they&rsquo;re seeing it become a resounding success, for the good work of the Drizzle project. It is not a technology incubator, nor is it the &ldquo;MySQL Drizzle Project.&rdquo; It is a new database server.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Apr 17, 2009</span>
        I&rsquo;m presenting about Maatkit, the toolkit I created to make life better with MySQL, at the MySQL conference next week.
I&rsquo;m going to give you a whirlwind tour through some of Maatkit&rsquo;s features and functionality. The toolkit is much too large and complex to cover more than a small part of it in depth. So here is your advance warning: I&rsquo;m going to go through a lot of material, and I won&rsquo;t be stopping for lengthy discussions :-) The Maatkit documentation is very thorough, and I hope to introduce you to things that could be of use to you, so you can go learn about those topics from the documentation.

        Having written about what I think is cool about the upcoming MySQL Conference and the MySQL Camp, now I want to finish up with what I&rsquo;d like to see at the Percona Performance Conference. Just to recap, this is a conference we created to serve those who want to learn about performance &ndash; not &ldquo;learn about MySQL,&rdquo; not &ldquo;learn about database performance,&rdquo; just learn about performance, period.
I want to see everything.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Apr 14, 2009</span>
        I wrote previously about what I&rsquo;m looking forward to at the upcoming MySQL Conference (next week!). Now I want to write about the free, community-organized unconference being held concurrently, MySQL Camp 2009.
It runs from Sunday through Thursday of next week, which is even longer than the MySQL conference. It starts Sunday with a day of games, then there are really good sessions throughout the week. In fact, I daresay the schedule is at times more interesting than the main MySQL conference:

        I haven&rsquo;t really decided my schedule yet during the conference, but I thought I&rsquo;d mention these sessions that look interesting to me.
I&rsquo;m presenting a session on how to use Maatkit, which I think attendees will get a lot of benefit from.
 Tuesday  This is Not a Web App: The Evolution of a MySQL Deployment at Google (keynote). Mark Callaghan, need I say more? MySQL and Search at Craigslist.

        As I said yesterday, I was only able to attend a couple of talks at the PostgreSQL Conference East 2009 this morning before leaving to catch my flight back to Virginia.
 Effects of Flash and SSDs on PostgreSQL &ndash; by Jignesh Shah of Sun Microsystems. Jignesh went through a series of comparisons between hard drives and SSD drives, looking at where they really make sense in terms of performance, capacity and price.

        I missed Friday and part of Saturday, but I was at PostgreSQL Conference East 2009 for part of Saturday (and will be for part of Sunday too.) A brief recap of the talks I attended:
 PostgreSQL Backup and Recovery &ndash; by Kevin Kempter of Consistent State. I arrived halfway through, and heard about PITR, Slony, and a few other topics. Playing with Playr &ndash; by Jonah Harris of myYearbook. Playr is a tool that analyzes log files, and lets you replay them exactly (same timing, same commit order, same concurrency, etc).

        I&rsquo;ve made plans to attend part of Saturday and part of Sunday at PostgreSQL Conference East 2009. I wish I could be there the whole time. Anyway I&rsquo;m just thrilled that I&rsquo;ll get to see people again, and meet new people I didn&rsquo;t get to meet before.
I think Josh Berkus has talked me into doing some kind of lightning talk on what the PostgreSQL community is doing right from my POV, and what parts of that I try to emulate in &ldquo;other&rdquo; areas of my professional life (if you know what I mean), though I can&rsquo;t see how that can actually fit into a lightning talk.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Feb 21, 2009</span>
        I&rsquo;m not sure this has been publicized much in the PostgreSQL world yet, but the Percona Performance Conference is not a MySQL-centric event. We&rsquo;re hoping for good sessions on PostgreSQL and lots of other topics. So this is an invitation &ndash; come attend, and submit sessions.
A few words about marketing. The event is free, and even though it&rsquo;s stamped with Percona&rsquo;s name and under Percona&rsquo;s control, it is a technical event.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Feb 19, 2009</span>
        I just returned from a MySQL Federal Migration Boot Camp, jointly presented by Carahsoft and Sun/MySQL. It was a half-day seminar on the topic of migrating applications to MySQL, targeted to the US Government sector. Specifically, most of the audience seemed to be running Oracle, though there were some users of other systems (Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, Informix, etc).
Ronald Bradford presented the whole thing. I thought he did a great job giving a fair and balanced look at topics such as what types of applications are good candidates for migration, what gotchas you might encounter, etc.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Feb 6, 2009</span>
        So far this year I&rsquo;ve been totally silent about the MySQL Conference and Expo 2009. In the past I&rsquo;ve been a vocal advocate of going to the conference and sending your employees to the conference. So my silence was conspicuous to me, if not to you. I&rsquo;ve always considered myself a strong MySQL supporter and I still do.
Why wasn&rsquo;t I telling people to go to this year&rsquo;s conference? Simple: I can&rsquo;t in good conscience tell people to attend an event from which I&rsquo;ve been excluded (oh, the irony).

        We (Percona) just announced our Percona Performance Conference, and I wanted to tell you a little more about what we hope to accomplish with this conference. Let me show you some simple math that anyone can do.
There&rsquo;s a handy iCal download of the conference schedule on the conference website. iCal is a plain text format that is easy to parse with a scripting language. I downloaded this year&rsquo;s and last year&rsquo;s schedules, and aggregated the number of times each company and speaker is listed as presenting a session.
