        Sheeri has posted an awesome list of talks with links to videos and slides from the MySQL conference. She did a lot of the video recording herself. I don&rsquo;t know how she could have posted them so fast &ndash; it&rsquo;s a lot of work.

        The video of my 5-minute Ignite talk on XtraDB is up on YouTube. Ignite talks have exactly 20 slides on auto-advance every 15 seconds. &ldquo;Enlighten us, and make it fast!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s better than a lightning talk. I explained the difference between Percona XtraDB and other technologies such as standard MySQL, OurDelta, and MariaDB.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Apr 18, 2010</span>
        I got a couple of questions and comments about OpenSQL Camp in the past week, and I thought it would be worth noting down the history, because I think there is some difference in perception and memory about this series of events. The following is only my point of view.
What is OpenSQL Camp? I can say what I had in mind when I created the original event, but this is bigger than me, so I don&rsquo;t get to dictate anything.

        After two years of just attending and heckling, this time I attended, heckled and presented! Here are the slides from my session demonstrating mk-query-digest&rsquo;s new PostgreSQL log-parsing functionality, which I gave at PgEast 2010 this past weekend. (Great conference, by the way.)

        I&rsquo;ve submitted a Birds of a Feather session for Maatkit at the upcoming MySQL conference. It&rsquo;s not on the public schedule yet, but it has been accepted and scheduled for 19:00 on 13 Apr 2010. See you there!

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Mar 3, 2010</span>
        One of my colleagues, Ryan Lowe, has just heard that his session on PCI compliance with MySQL has been accepted at the upcoming MySQL conference. Ryan is highly qualified to present this topic, and not many people can say that; I certainly can&rsquo;t claim that title myself. If you&rsquo;re looking to learn how to make your MySQL installation PCI-compliant, there&rsquo;s also not a lot of trustworthy information online. Personally &ndash; and really, no bias just because he&rsquo;s my colleague &ndash; I think this is a great session for the MySQL conference, which I sometimes thought didn&rsquo;t have enough diversity of topics in past years.

        I&rsquo;m speaking at the O&rsquo;Reilly MySQL Conference 2010. I hope I don&rsquo;t lose my voice, because I have four sessions!
 Diagnosing and Fixing MySQL Performance Problems EXPLAIN Demystified Read-Write Splitting: Techniques, Challenges, and Solutions MySQL Graphing and Trending with Cacti  You can click through on the links above to learn more about each session.

        I&rsquo;ll be attending PgEast this year, as I&rsquo;ve done for the last couple of years, and this year I&rsquo;ll also be speaking. The topic is query analysis with mk-query-digest. The official description of my talk is as follows:
 mk-query-digest is a powerful open-source tool for capturing, filtering, transforming, and aggregating queries, with the ability to do all sorts of other advanced tasks too. By default, it aggregates similar queries together and presents a designed-for-DBAs report with statistics about the most important queries, so you can see where to focus your optimization efforts.

        I&rsquo;m on the voting committee of the MySQL Conference this year. I was on the same committee in 2008. This year&rsquo;s submissions are awesome. Much different from previous years, for whatever reason.
Some of the proposals are sales pitches, infomercials, or just generally BS, but there&rsquo;s a gang of sharp-eyed people on the committee who are digging into who submits the proposals, what their company does, etc. Those sessions are getting shot down with bluntly honest reviews and low votes.

        I&rsquo;m on the MySQL conference committee again this year, so I&rsquo;ll be reading and voting on your session proposals. My past experience is that reading 400 session proposals is a mind-numbing job, and I will be optimizing it to save my time. That means I will be scanning your proposals and deciding very quickly how to vote. I wrote before about how to submit a great proposal, but I&rsquo;ve refined my opinion since then.

        I was at OpenSQL Camp 2009 in Portland last weekend. I thought the event was very well done. On Friday we had a pizza party at Old Town Pizza, which was awesome. Saturday and Sunday were breakfast, sessions, lunch (yum), and sessions and hacking. These were held at souk, a co-working space. After 5PM, people got together for dinner, beer, etc.
I presented on mk-query-digest &ndash; a live demo of features requested by the audience.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 14, 2009</span>
        Last week I attended the Enterprise LAMP Summit and Camp in Nashville, Tennessee. I enjoyed the event and met or reconnected with a lot of great people. I was glad to be able to spend time with some folks from the Postgres community. My own sessions focused on MySQL.
During the Summit I tried to help people understand how to think about performance, and made the case that the Percona versions of the MySQL server are not only the highest-performance available, but uniquely provide the instrumentation necessary to follow a disciplined performance optimization process such as Method R or Goal-Driven Performance Optimization.

        I&rsquo;ve bought my plane tickets for OpenSQL Camp US 2009, in Portland, Oregon on the weekend of November 14th. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to the event and seeing friends again. And I&rsquo;m psyched that the third incarnation of this event is taking place! I wish I could have been at the 2nd one too, earlier this year in Europe.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Oct 18, 2009</span>
        Yesterday I attended CPOSC 2009. The conference was great. It was very well run, and I liked the sessions. I would definitely attend this conference again, and will recommend that Percona sponsor it next year. I attended the following talks:
 Stop Worrying and Start Monitoring with Nagios (Andrew Libby) DRBD, Network Raid, High Availability and General Awesomeness (Brian Gorka) MySQL Performance Tuning for non-DBAs (Tom Clark) Wonderful Desktop Tricks, and Aesthetics (Seth Jerome) Jump Start Django: The Web Framework for Perfectionists with Deadlines (Rob Yates) Watching and Manipulating Your Network Traffic (Josiah Ritchie)  And then of course I gave my own talk on Maatkit (slides).

By the way, I&rsquo;ve also created a speaker badge by adapting a wallpaper someone else made &ndash; you can find it on the sidebar of my blog if you&rsquo;re also a speaker.

        I am speaking at Enterprise LAMP Summit 2009 (and also should be speaking at the Camp the next day, but I see the schedule isn&rsquo;t quite updated yet). My talk at the Summit will not be on the future landscape of MySQL &ndash; that&rsquo;s a mistake. My talk&rsquo;s title isn&rsquo;t finalized yet.
This conference is the first weekend in November, in the Nashville area. I hope to see you there!

        There are two OpenSQL Camp events in 2009. This is a conference about any and all open-source databases. The slogan of the inaugural event was &ldquo;of, by, and for the community.&rdquo;
The first of this year&rsquo;s events just ended last weekend in Germany, and I&rsquo;m really sad that neither I nor anyone else from Percona could attend. But fortunately the amazing crew of organizers has already posted videos of the sessions!

I&rsquo;ll give an overview of the toolkit, which is no longer an easy task in a single session. I see a number of other interesting sessions have been accepted. It looks like it&rsquo;ll be a good conference.
