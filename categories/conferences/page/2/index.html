        <span class="post-date">Wed, Feb 13, 2013</span>
        I&rsquo;m really looking forward to this year&rsquo;s Percona Live MySQL Conference. This is always THE event of the year for me in the MySQL conference circuit. It&rsquo;s also the first year I haven&rsquo;t been a speaker! I&rsquo;ve been a speaker since 2007 but this year things were too uncertain for me to submit a proposal in time.
As usual, the real highlight of the conference is seeing and talking to everyone.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Apr 8, 2012</span>
        In case you live under a rock, the MySQL conference starts on Tuesday. There are 8 concurrent tracks of content. Aside from my own talks, here are the sessions I would most like to see.
On Tuesday:
 Tutorial: Innodb and XtraDB Architecture and Performance Optimization. Peter&rsquo;s talks are always great, and this is a perennial favorite. If you have never been, you should go to this one. You will realize how little you really know about InnoDB/XtraDB, and how much it matters.

        We&rsquo;re running Birds of a Feather (BoF) sessions and lightning talks this year at the MySQL conference, similarly to previous years. You can help by submitting proposals ASAP. The deadline is Monday, and it is a hard deadline.
Submit a BoF Session &bull; Submit a Lightning Talk
Why is this a big deal? Why the hard deadline? It turns out that this is one of the things I always underestimated. Planning for these is actually quite difficult and they are very expensive.

        I presented at this year&rsquo;s [Hotsos Symposium](). I am searching for a claim to specialness, and I think it may be that I am the first Hotsos presenter who&rsquo;s specifically focused on MySQL. True? I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;ll run with it for now.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Dec 20, 2011</span>
        If you are using or considering MySQL, and you&rsquo;re in the Washington DC area, there&rsquo;s an excellent MySQL conference coming up on January 11th. I know because I am helping organize it.
The event is Percona Live. It&rsquo;s the latest installment in our series of regional events, which have been very well received in New York, London, and San Francisco. Take a look at the schedule of talks &ndash; this will be a very solid day of learning and networking.

        This post is a followup to some promises I made at Postgres Open.
Instrumentation can be a lot of work to add to a server, and it can add overhead to the server too. The bits of instrumentation I&rsquo;ll advocate in this post are few and trivial, but disproportionately powerful.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Oct 6, 2011</span>
        This year&rsquo;s Surge conference was a great sophomore event to follow up last year&rsquo;s inaugural conference. A lot of very smart people were there, and the hallway track was great.
I presented on three things: a lightning talk about causes of MySQL downtime; I chaired a panel on Big Data and the Cloud; and I showed how to derive scalability and performance metrics from TCP traffic. I&rsquo;ve sent my slides to the Surge organizers, and I understand that they will be posting them as well as integrating them into the video of my session.

        Two of my proposals for Percona Live London on October 24-25 have been approved! Yes, I really had to propose them and get them approved like everyone else, although as I&rsquo;m sure you can imagine, I had a good chance at being accepted :-) Not all of my talks were accepted, though.
I&rsquo;ll be presenting a half-day tutorial on how to get great results when troubleshooting MySQL problems, and a conference session on how to use TCP packet headers to measure and analyze a surprising variety of aspects of MySQL performance and scalability.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Sep 19, 2011</span>
        I thought that Postgres Open 2011 was very well done. I liked the content, the location, and most especially the atmosphere, which felt much more welcoming than some PostgreSQL conferences I&rsquo;ve attended. This last point bears repeating: I&rsquo;d exceeded my tolerance for trash talk about MySQL at other conferences, and this event made me feel valued again. I believe that the leaders and organizers set the tone, so I think that Selena and the committee deserve a lot of credit and thanks for the warm atmosphere.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Aug 18, 2011</span>
        I am writing this on my blog because I want to take the Percona hat off (partially) and wear my community hat a bit. My loyalty was to the MySQL community long before I was involved with Percona.
There are now three Percona Live events for which we have signed venue contracts and begun plans: London in October, Washington DC in January, and Santa Clara in April. I have insider knowledge of what&rsquo;s going on with planning all three events, and I&rsquo;m proud and happy that I have a community-member seat at the table.

        If you&rsquo;re going to Surge, which you should, you need to book your hotel now, or you&rsquo;ll lose the conference discount. It&rsquo;s a nice hotel and a great discount. It also supports the conference if you book this hotel &ndash; conference venues typically put a requirement in the contract that they must sell X number of rooms for the conference, or the organizer has to pay a penalty.

        I&rsquo;ll be presenting at Oracle Open World on the causes of downtime in MySQL, and how to prevent it. This is a research-based session that presents an easy-to-digest post-mortem of hundreds of emergency issues filed by Percona customers. The real causes and types of downtime surprised me quite a bit, and the preventions run counter to a lot of conventional wisdom. I&rsquo;ll just give a preview by saying that you should consider it a top priority to monitor how full your disks are!

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Jul 6, 2011</span>
        I&rsquo;ll be speaking at Surge again this year. This time, unlike last year&rsquo;s talk, I&rsquo;m tackling a very concrete topic: extracting scalability and performance metrics from TCP network traffic. It turns out that most things that communicate over TCP can be analyzed very elegantly just by capturing arrival and departure timestamps of packets, nothing more. I&rsquo;ll show examples where different views on the same data pull out completely different insights about the application, even though we have no information about the application itself (okay, I actually know that it&rsquo;s a MySQL database, and a lot about the actual database and workload, but I don&rsquo;t need that in order to do what I&rsquo;ll show you).

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 18, 2011</span>
        I split my time last week between the IOUG&rsquo;s Collaborate conference in Orlando, Florida and O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s MySQL Conference &#038; Expo in California. The contrast was stark. For me as a MySQLer, Collaborate was a dud. On the other hand, the MySQL conference O&rsquo;Reilly puts on is superb. It is vital to MySQL as a project and as a community, and it follows that it&rsquo;s vital to MySQL&rsquo;s business success. Oracle needs to participate to make it a success in the future.

        If you&rsquo;ve used OpenOffice.org Impress to run a slideshow with your laptop plugged into an external monitor or projector, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed that it prefers to switch the primary and secondary display, showing you the slideshow while it shows your audience the notes and preview of your next slide! This is exactly the reverse of what you want, which is to show your audience the slideshow and let you see notes, the countdown timer, and so on.

        I&rsquo;ll be speaking at IOUG&rsquo;s Collaborate conference in Florida the week of April 10-14. My session is called MySQL Performance Basics. For those who know MySQL, this won&rsquo;t be exciting, but if you&rsquo;re new to it, I hope it will be a good orientation to what you should focus on and ignore.
Sheeri Cabral posted a good round-up of the MySQL talks at Collaborate on the PalominoDB blog.

        I wish I could be at the Hotsos Symposium. I would keep my mouth very tightly closed and my ears wide open, and try to learn from people who are completely out of my league about performance analysis topics I won&rsquo;t grok for another decade (if I&rsquo;m lucky). But I just can&rsquo;t cram in that much travel.
If you&rsquo;re like me, why don&rsquo;t you go to the O&rsquo;Reilly MySQL Conference instead?
