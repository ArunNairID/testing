          <description>&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pgconfsv.com/&#34;&gt;PGConfSV&lt;/a&gt; yet, it&amp;rsquo;s a
conference for the Silicon Valley PostgreSQL community and beyond, featuring
leading PostgreSQL performance and scalability experts. It&amp;rsquo;s happening November
17-18 at the South San Francisco Conference Center. I encourage everyone in the
area to attend, since this is likely to be the best Postgres conference held
thus far in the Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also urge you to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pgconf-silicon-valley-2015-tickets-16521286613&#34;&gt;buy your tickets&lt;/a&gt; before they sell out! Of course, the earlier
you buy, the more you save, too. (Use SeeMeSpeak for a 20% discount).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/10/ssfcc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Convention Center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be at the conference along with some of my colleagues. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited
about this for a few reasons. Allow me to &amp;lsquo;splain why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2008/04/01/postgresql-conference-east-2008/&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve loved PostgreSQL for a long
time&lt;/a&gt; although fate has
mostly seen me work in the MySQL community. I&amp;rsquo;ve attended, spoken, helped
organize and otherwise been involved in a handful of Postgres events, and this
conference brings back a lot of good memories and anticipation. Among other
things, Terry Erisman is one of the principal organizers and he does a
&lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; job of overseeing conferences. Seriously. He&amp;rsquo;s one of the big
reasons the MySQL conference not only continued, but rebounded after the dark
days of the Sun acquisition. PostgreSQL fans should be thrilled to have him
involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vividcortex.com/&#34;&gt;VividCortex&lt;/a&gt; is a sponsor, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be
there in an official capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pgconfsv.com/sessions/analyzing-postgresql-network-traffic-vc-pgsql-sniffer&#34;&gt;speaking&lt;/a&gt;
about sniffing the network protocol off the wire and analyzing it. If you&amp;rsquo;ve
seen any of my talks about &amp;ldquo;finding hidden treasures in TCP traffic&amp;rdquo; kinds of
topics, hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll have an idea of what might be in store in that talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also participated in an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.citusdata.com/blog/25-terry/261-pgconf-silicon-valley-speaker-baron-schwartz-vividcortex-%E2%80%8E&#34;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;
leading up to the conference, on why I&amp;rsquo;m so excited not only about this
particular event, but also why I&amp;rsquo;m more and more excited about PostgreSQL in
general. As a community and as a technology, it&amp;rsquo;s really exploding onto the
scene in ways a lot of people don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate yet. (But they will!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come be a part of the next big sea change in opensource relational databases!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>How to Organize a Tech Conference</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/10/06/organizing-conferences/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2015 10:53:36 -0400</pubDate>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Running a conference is hard work, and lots of things need to come together in
just the right way to make it a great experience for everyone. This blog post is
a collection of the most important things I&amp;rsquo;ve seen conference organizers get
wrong (with the best intentions). It&amp;rsquo;s not comprehensive, but I  hope it will
help point out &amp;ldquo;low-hanging fruit&amp;rdquo; for interested people. Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll be
able to avoid some of the mistakes as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/10/audience.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;audience&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;know-your-audiences&#34;&gt;Know Your Audiences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I organized my first tech conference in 2008 and I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a great job. I
focused almost exclusively on the experience of the attendees, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t
understand the broader picture. Fortunately others helped and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a
disaster. I learned a lot from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several audiences at a conference, not a single one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attendees&lt;/strong&gt; typically say they come for great content, fun, networking, and
inspiration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt; usually speak for their own interests, a company&amp;rsquo;s, or
altruistically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vendors or Sponsors&lt;/strong&gt; usually want to attract relevant potential buyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizers&lt;/strong&gt; often have an interest in bringing the attendees and sponsors
together. It might be a company that makes a business from running
conferences, as with O&amp;rsquo;Reilly; or it could be a group of people interested in
promoting a community or technology, as with Gophercon and the Go language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious to state these things, but so often conference organizers
ignore the needs of one of the audiences. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget, too, that there are
others such as the local community (e.g. the restaurants and hotels nearby).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-balanced conference is a conscious choice to mix the interests and needs
of all of the audiences as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;food-and-drink&#34;&gt;Food and Drink&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good food and drink (coffee, alcoholic beverages) at a conference is extremely
important. Without these, the conference gets destroyed and reconvened
several times a day. People have to leave and try to find some food, wait in
lines, walk around in the rain, get lost, come back late and miss the talks they
wanted to see (thus disrupting the talks when they enter late)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feed your attendees unless you&amp;rsquo;re right in the middle of a food paradise.
You&amp;rsquo;ll reap the rewards and so will they. Get sponsors to help and it&amp;rsquo;ll be a
virtuous circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you feed them is also very important. I&amp;rsquo;m gluten sensitive and I can&amp;rsquo;t tell
you how many times I&amp;rsquo;ve walked down a buffet line, only to see literally nothing
I can eat. The menu is things like bread, pasta, sandwiches, couscous salad and
pizza. Not kidding&amp;mdash;gluten (and high carbs/starches) in every single dish. And
what about people with common allergies such as nuts? Salads with nuts in them,
or cheese sprinkled instead of being in a separate dish&amp;hellip; These things aren&amp;rsquo;t
hard to fix. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to accommodate most peoples&amp;rsquo; needs. Just ask for help from
someone whose diet isn&amp;rsquo;t like yours; find a gluten-sensitive vegetarian for
example. There are lots of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;planning-in-advance&#34;&gt;Planning In Advance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many conferences don&amp;rsquo;t plan far enough in advance. Not planning and announcing
things leads to a lot of problems. You have to consider your audiences, again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sponsors are committing to other events and their calendars are filling up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speakers are too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the attendees, sponsors, and speakers are not only committing to other
things, but may have challenges getting coverage for family needs (babysitter
help while they&amp;rsquo;re away), booking travel at reasonable rates, and the like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wait longer than other shows to open and announce your call for
proposals, in particular, you won&amp;rsquo;t get proposals because other shows will
already have accepted the speakers you want. This typically means at least 6
months, often 8 months. Back out the schedule and see where you need to plan; it
varies depending on the type of event, but you want a good amount of time to
sell tickets (and if there&amp;rsquo;s any travel involved you need to do that much
earlier), a chunk of time for going through various ticket pricing increases
such as early-bird and discount; time for a committee and community to promote
the agenda you&amp;rsquo;ve chosen; time for the committee to choose the speakers and
talks; time for the talks to be submitted; time for the word to get out&amp;mdash;again, you need at least 6 months as a bare minimum for most events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had to miss a lot of great conferences because the organizers didn&amp;rsquo;t plan
and announce far enough in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CfP is particularly important. It needs to be announced and publicized
repeatedly. It&amp;rsquo;s a big effort. It also needs to be highly visible on the
conference website. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen conferences with CfPs inadvertently accessible
only from links in emails and Tweets, not directly linked from the website.
The website needs to promote whatever&amp;rsquo;s stage-appropriate as time passes: the
CfP, registration, and then the schedule/agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many conferences I know don&amp;rsquo;t do a good enough job asking last year&amp;rsquo;s speakers
to speak again at future events. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten emails asking me why I didn&amp;rsquo;t
propose talks for a show where I was a speaker in previous years, implying that
I&amp;rsquo;d shunned the conference, when the reality is the conference ignored &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. I
heard nothing about the conference or CfP until the accusatory email. This
should not be hard; use MailChimp or similar to just create a simple email list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very important part of announcement and promotion is to use a guaranteed
delivery format such as email, not a maybe-you-notice-it social media channel. I
have known conferences that rely on Twitter. They didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that a
significant part of their audience was not watching their Twitter account. They
assumed their speakers, in particular, were watching them intently&amp;mdash;when the
reality is the speakers were leading lives doing other things. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten blank
stares at times when I remarked on this being the reason I missed things. Email
is key.  Twitter is auxiliary. Again, build email lists in MailChimp and keep
records in spreadsheets, don&amp;rsquo;t wing it or do it ad-hoc. Otherwise you will miss
important things and important people, and the result will be hurt feelings and
burned bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can, announce the next year&amp;rsquo;s date and venue during each show. Many
people and companies really do need to plan a full year in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;speaker-selection-acceptance-and-announcement&#34;&gt;Speaker Selection, Acceptance, and Announcement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to treat speakers respectfully. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t been in their shoes, it
is easy to mess this up badly. Here is a sample of the ways conferences have
inadvertently treated me badly as a speaker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burdensome processes that ask me to jump through hoops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking too long to make a decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failing to confirm acceptance or rejection with me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publishing and promoting my talk before getting my acceptance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accepting my talk publicly, e.g. on Twitter, instead of privately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst speaker management sin an organizer can commit, in my opinion, is
promoting me as a speaker without asking me first. I&amp;rsquo;ve had this happen several
times when I had already made conflicting plans because the conference didn&amp;rsquo;t
plan and announce early enough. Then it looks like I am the jerk for backing
out. Not cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, the choice of whether to pay speakers (or just reimburse them) is
highly dependent on many factors, so I don&amp;rsquo;t think any universal policy is
appropriate for me to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conference-format&#34;&gt;Conference Format&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of single-track conferences. Examples are Monitorama and
Gophercon. The temptation to cram more content in by multi-tracking is strong
and I understand the pressures. Organizers who resist this end up with the
highest quality conferences I&amp;rsquo;ve ever participated in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that big trade shows are a different matter and I&amp;rsquo;ve organized
those too. That&amp;rsquo;s fine, those are necessary. But if you want to respect speakers
and attendees and really achieve a goal of community building and education,
single-track is the way to do it. There is a way to work sponsorship into this,
by the way, although naturally such a conference is less focused on sponsors.
Monitorama does a great job of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;diversity-and-safety&#34;&gt;Diversity and Safety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a mission statement. Everything changes when you do. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be
public. Just know why you&amp;rsquo;re doing what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; have and enforce a code of conduct. Don&amp;rsquo;t invent one, just copy one
from a conference that does it well and offers theirs for reuse. If you don&amp;rsquo;t
know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about you really need to do more research on this
yourself. It&amp;rsquo;s beyond the scope of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, having a diverse committee will produce a much better conference.
You&amp;rsquo;ll avoid all kinds of problems that come from monocultures (such as a
gluten-only menu). These problems are easily avoided; it&amp;rsquo;s a really simple thing
to just get some diversity onto the committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mission statement and a diverse committee should take care of all the other
things you will care about for your specific event (such as outreach to and
inclusion of a diverse audience and roster of speakers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;give-sponsors-what-they-pay-for&#34;&gt;Give Sponsors What They Pay For&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sponsors/vendors/exhibitors do not want to ruin your conference, they want to
improve it. If you have not been one, you might not understand their needs, and
again you might make simple mistakes that are literally the difference between
them getting their money&amp;rsquo;s worth or you losing next year&amp;rsquo;s sponsorship goodwill.
Here are some simple mistakes I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that wreck things for sponsors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failing to print name and affiliation (company) in large type on badges.
Sponsors at a booth are very busy and they want to save their staff&amp;rsquo;s time as
well as treat the booth visitors well. The name and company need to be visible
from a few paces away. You&amp;rsquo;d be surprised how many people come to a conference
with the express purpose of cruising the expo hall and trying to prey on the
sponsors (e.g. trying to sell them cloud hosting). This gets in the way of
what the sponsors are there for. Name badges solve a lot of this: you can ask
people to move along so you can spend time with the right people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failing to print a QR or other scannable code on a badge for sponsors to
efficiently take a record that follow up is needed. This is not evil. It&amp;rsquo;s
time efficiency. People who have no interest in being scanned will not present
their badges for scanning. Sponsors who are savvy are only scanning badges
when there&amp;rsquo;s a good conversation that results in a follow-up request anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not including sponsors in the show. A classic mistake is holding a reception
or open bar outside of the booth area. Shows that lay out the booth area so
that lunch, coffee, and reception traffic flows through it are doing everyone
a favor. Many attendees also want to browse the exhibit hall but can&amp;rsquo;t if they
have conflicting needs (I need to go get my coffee and get back to another
session, I can&amp;rsquo;t make time to go out of my way for the expo!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interfering with conversations in the booth area.  &lt;strong&gt;No loud music in the expo
hall!&lt;/strong&gt; If you have music or a DJ, keep it &lt;em&gt;background&lt;/em&gt;.  Sponsors don&amp;rsquo;t want
to have to lean into people&amp;rsquo;s faces and yell to be heard. At a recent
conference I was literally wiping spit from my face as people at the booth
asked me to demonstrate VividCortex, and repeated requests to turn it down
were not respected over the course of several days. This one&amp;rsquo;s a personal
peeve for me, as people who know me can attest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conferences organized by people who&amp;rsquo;ve been exhibitors are usually easy to tell
from those that are just organized by people who&amp;rsquo;ve spoken/attended. If sponsors
and exhibit areas are afterthoughts it&amp;rsquo;s a waste of time and money for sponsors.
Again, including a diversity of viewpoints on a committee helps avoid simple
mistakes like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you a sense of how important this is, I do reference checks on every
single conference we decide to sponsor at VividCortex. I will look at last
year&amp;rsquo;s event and see who sponsored, then call or email them and ask if they had
a good experience. I also regularly give feedback to other companies, so I&amp;rsquo;m not
the only one who does this. A lot of conferences that get rave reviews from
attendees (best tech conference I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in years!) are a waste of time for
sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good advice is to think of how to put talks on one side, an expo hall in the
middle, and food and drink either intermingled with or on the other side of the
expo hall. It usually can be done. Few things are more frustrating to a
sponsor than flying across an ocean, setting up a booth, and sitting at the
booth alone for the evening reception/party while all the drinking and talking
is happening two rooms over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the type of conference, it might be appropriate to help publicize
the sponsor&amp;rsquo;s participation. This can be as simple as tweeting about the sponsor
(or sponsored talks), inclusion in newsletters, press releases, all the way up
to dedicated publicity campaigns. It can definitely be overdone, however.
One cloud event is unlike anything I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. They are obviously hiring armies of
social media spam accounts, because there have been thousands of Tweets like the
following (redacted to avoid naming names):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/10/cloudexpo.png&#34; alt=&#34;cloudexpo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s definitely not the way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;be-nice-to-the-organizers&#34;&gt;Be Nice To The Organizers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizing a conference is a stressful job. There are so many potholes you can
step in. Some have serious consequences, such as using PayPal to accept payment
and having all your funds frozen.  That kind of thing can destroy an event (or
even an organizer&amp;rsquo;s personal finances). And a lot of stuff has to be done by the
seat of your pants or at the last minute, unless you&amp;rsquo;re a pro and have it down
to a set of checklists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, if you&amp;rsquo;re a sponsor, attendee, or speaker, please try to be nice to the
organizers. They&amp;rsquo;re doing their best. It&amp;rsquo;s much harder than you think it is to
run a conference. (It&amp;rsquo;s also way more expensive.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lots-of-other-things&#34;&gt;Lots Of Other Things&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are tons of other things that can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad wifi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad A/V&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trouble with vendors, unions, and logistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And so on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these are largely things that most conference organizers are aware of,
in my experience. They may do a good job or not, but they&amp;rsquo;re not ignorant of it.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to focus on things that conferences seem to get wrong
repeatedly because they&amp;rsquo;re non-obvious mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback is welcome!&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>History Repeats: MySQL, MongoDB, Percona, and Open Source</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/05/22/percona-mongodb-mysql-history-repeat/</link>
          <pubDate>Fri, 22 May 2015 13:51:18 -0500</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/05/22/percona-mongodb-mysql-history-repeat/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;History is repeating again. MongoDB is breaking out of the niche into the
mainstream, performance and instrumentation are terrible in specific cases,
MongoDB isn&amp;rsquo;t able to fix all the problems alone, and an ecosystem is growing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/05/leaf.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Leaf&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should really be a series of blog posts, because there&amp;rsquo;s a book&amp;rsquo;s worth of
things happening, but I&amp;rsquo;ll summarize instead. Randomly ordered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB is in many respects closely following MySQL&amp;rsquo;s development, 10 years
offset. Single index per query, MyISAM-like storage engine, etc.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2013/04/29/what-tokudb-might-mean-for-mongodb/&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokutek built an excellent transactional storage engine and replaced
MongoDB&amp;rsquo;s, calling it TokuMX. Results were dramatically better performance
(plus ACID). MongoDB&amp;rsquo;s response was to buy WiredTiger and make it the default
storage engine in MongoDB 3.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Percona acquired Tokutek. A book should be written about this someday. The
impact to both the MySQL and MongoDB communities cannot be overstated. This
changes everything. It also changes everything for Percona, which now has a
truly differentiated product for both database offerings. This moves them
solidly into being a product company, not just support/services/consulting; it
is a good answer to the quandary of trying to keep up with the InnoDB
engineers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook acquired Parse, which is probably one of the larger MongoDB
installations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facebook&amp;rsquo;s Mark Callaghan, among others, stopped spending all his time on
InnoDB mutexes and so forth. For the last year or so he&amp;rsquo;s been extremely
active in the MongoDB community. The MongoDB community is lucky to have a
genius of Mark&amp;rsquo;s caliber finding and solving problems. There are others, but
if Mark Callaghan is working on your open source product in earnest, you&amp;rsquo;ve
arrived.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Just as in MySQL, but even earlier, there are lots of -As-A-Service providers
for MongoDB, and it&amp;rsquo;s likely a significant portion of future growth happens
here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MongoDB&amp;rsquo;s conference is jaw-droppingly expensive for a vendor, to the point of
being exclusive. At the same time, MongoDB hasn&amp;rsquo;t quite recognized and
embraced some of the things going on outside their walls. If you remember &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.percona.com/blog/2009/02/05/announcing-percona-performance-conference-2009-on-april-22-23/&#34;&gt;the
events of 2009 in the MySQL
community&lt;/a&gt;,
Percona&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.percona.com/news-and-events/mongodb-events/mongodb-community-openhouse&#34;&gt;announcement of an alternative MongoDB
conference&lt;/a&gt;
might feel a little like deja vu. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure of the backstory behind this,
though.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time that history is repeating in the MongoDB world, a tremendous
amount of stuff is happening quietly in other major communities too. Especially
MySQL, but also in PostgreSQL, ElasticSearch, Cassandra and other opensource
databases. I&amp;rsquo;m probably only qualified to write about the MySQL side of things;
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure most people don&amp;rsquo;t know a lot of the interesting things that are
going on behind the scenes that will have long-lasting effects. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll write
about that someday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile, I think we&amp;rsquo;re all in for an exciting ride as MongoDB &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2013/01/10/bold-predictions-on-which-nosql-databases-will-survive/&#34;&gt;proves me right&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PS: VividCortex is building a MongoDB monitoring solution that will address many
of the shortcomings of existing ones. (We have been a bit quiet about it, just
out of busyness rather than a desire for secrecy, but now you know.) It&amp;rsquo;s in
beta now.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>What I Look For In A Conference Proposal</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/05/18/what-i-look-for-conference-proposal/</link>

          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/05/18/what-i-look-for-conference-proposal/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written a few times before about how to write a good conference proposal.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the committee of various conferences many times. It&amp;rsquo;s surprising
how few people actually can write good proposals. Somehow it&amp;rsquo;s also suprisingly
hard to explain what makes a good one, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to give this another try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/05/laptop.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Laptop&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the key thing to remember, and the reason it&amp;rsquo;s so hard to write a good
proposal, is that you&amp;rsquo;re writing to several audiences simultaneously. By the
way, I don&amp;rsquo;t claim to be good at this myself. Like I said, it&amp;rsquo;s hard. When I
look at my own proposals I often cringe and think, &amp;ldquo;why wasn&amp;rsquo;t I able to do a
better job on this one?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your primary audiences are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reviewers or conference committee. An excellent talk that&amp;rsquo;s not accepted
is an excellent talk that never happens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The audience who&amp;rsquo;s trying to figure out what talks to attend. An excellent
talk that doesn&amp;rsquo;t draw a crowd is a failure, frankly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also have to think about the medium and context where the audiences see the
session proposal. Let&amp;rsquo;s dig into each audience and see what&amp;rsquo;s going through
their minds. If you don&amp;rsquo;t do this you&amp;rsquo;re not going to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reviewers-and-conference-committees&#34;&gt;Reviewers and Conference Committees&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reviewers are scanning through several hundred proposals. It&amp;rsquo;s a lot of
work. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried to go through a stack of resumes, it&amp;rsquo;s similar to
that. Picture yourself reviewing 20 or 50 conference proposals in a row.  Would
your brain turn off? I can assure you that after 100, 200, 300 proposals it&amp;rsquo;s
difficult to stay sharp and objective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a reviewer, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to keep a lot of things in mind, and make decisions
&lt;strong&gt;quickly&lt;/strong&gt;. Frankly I have to. I don&amp;rsquo;t have days to spend on this. You have to
help me with this. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good title. It should be short, punchy, accurate, and clear. It should
avoid buzzwords. There&amp;rsquo;s an unfortunate tendency for a lot of proposals to
have titles like &amp;ldquo;The something, the something, and the something: some words
after the colon that really matter.&amp;rdquo; I do not think this is a successful
pattern. Everything before the colon is wasted. I would advise reading
Copyblogger&amp;rsquo;s Magnetic Headlines series. There are a hundred ways to write a
great title. &lt;strong&gt;Titles matter more than anything else.&lt;/strong&gt; Don&amp;rsquo;t waste your
title.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The presenter. Who is it? Where do they work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The submitter. Is it a PR-submitted presentation? If you have someone submit
your proposal on your behalf, it&amp;rsquo;s instant skepticism. Lots of people just
shotgun-submit canned proposals to tons of conferences. They have speaking
quotas to fill. They&amp;rsquo;re professional mouthpieces. They rarely are good for
the conference and I&amp;rsquo;m on guard against them. My advice is to submit your own
sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The body of the proposal. This varies by conference; some have just one piece
of content, some have a short abstract and a longer description, for use in
specific media (I&amp;rsquo;ll get to this later). The main thing here is that &lt;strong&gt;you
need to be clear and honest&lt;/strong&gt; in these. You cannot make me work to understand
you. I&amp;rsquo;ll repeat that for emphasis. &lt;strong&gt;You cannot make me work to understand
you.&lt;/strong&gt; I have to be able to immediately grasp what you&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about
and what the audience will take away from it. I also need to know what your
assertions are. You can&amp;rsquo;t just ask questions and leave me wondering if you
have answers and what they are. An example is &lt;em&gt;in today&amp;rsquo;s hyper-networked
world, is a meal with your boss still relevant?&lt;/em&gt; You need to make your
position clear. Eliminate ambiguity. You&amp;rsquo;re not giving away your secrets, and
mystery isn&amp;rsquo;t a winning tactic for getting people to your talk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any sign of vendor pitches. I love when vendors clearly go out of their way
to provide valuable content. For example, right now I&amp;rsquo;ve just reviewed some
proposals from a CDN provider about image optimization. The CDN&amp;rsquo;s customer
base is clearly going to care greatly about this and it&amp;rsquo;s a great service to
them.  Win. If it were a talk about why you need CDNs and how CDNs save money
and improve performance, that&amp;rsquo;s a vendor pitch. I don&amp;rsquo;t believe you&amp;rsquo;ll give a
good talk on this. If it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;learn how Big Company X and Big Company Y
migrated to a HybridCDN and saved&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; pitch. This is not the place for case
studies and vendor ads. If you can&amp;rsquo;t tell if it passes the sniff test, a) get
someone else to check, and b) don&amp;rsquo;t submit it. Think of a different topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Related) End runs. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to propose Topic A while planning to present on
something more pitchy.  I&amp;rsquo;ll smell you out, I promise. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing the sixth
sense you develop reading a few hundred proposals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buzzword bingo. Be yourself and present what you have to offer. Don&amp;rsquo;t try to
ride hype waves. Everyone else is doing that, &lt;em&gt;trust me&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key guidelines I&amp;rsquo;d give here are to make your proposal absolutely clear and
as brief as you can. Take a lot of time and make it possible to scan and
instantly figure out what the talk is about. That&amp;rsquo;s what a committee member is
doing: trying to figure out what you&amp;rsquo;re about and what the talk is about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the old quote, often attributed to Mark Twain?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write you a short letter, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have time, so I wrote you a
long one instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the time to make your proposal short.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, the other thing I&amp;rsquo;m doing as a committee member is trying to judge whether
the session proposal is &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; or not.  To decide that, I have to put myself
into the shoes of the second audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-attendees&#34;&gt;The Attendees&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The attendees are the second audience, and as a committee member/reviewer it&amp;rsquo;s
my job to decide whether the talk is good for them. A successful proposal will
be a good experience during the conference, but more importantly, &lt;strong&gt;the proposal
has to lure the audience in.&lt;/strong&gt; A talk that&amp;rsquo;s given to an empty room is a
failure, no matter how good it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you know how the audience decides what they&amp;rsquo;re going to attend?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They look at the printed grid of the schedule, in most cases. It looks like
this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/05/session-grid.png&#34; alt=&#34;session grid&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what can we conclude from this? &lt;strong&gt;Spend a lot of effort on your headline.&lt;/strong&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m not going to throw stones at glass houses, but most headlines/titles are
&lt;em&gt;terrible&lt;/em&gt;. You have an opportunity to really stand out here. Your title
will be read in isolation, most of the time. Embrace that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some cases, if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky, audiences will read a little more deeply. It
might look like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/05/session-hover.png&#34; alt=&#34;session hover&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is still not a lot of content to work with. You have to make every word
punch above its weight!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t, you will not get people in the room. It&amp;rsquo;s as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your actual talk/presentation is not what matters. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter how high
quality it is. What you&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;selling,&amp;rdquo; both to the audience and to the committee,
is the proposal. Not the talk itself. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that. The talk is just
follow-through on your promise of a great session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-i-rate-proposals&#34;&gt;How I Rate Proposals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve read through your proposal and thought about these fundamentals
(what talk do you plan to give, and how will the audience perceive your
proposal) I need to judge and rate you. How do I do this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to rate talks based on these things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is this the right talk for the conference? Is it on-topic?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the talk, itself, likely to be high quality?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any disqualifiers, such as vendor pitchiness?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does this speaker really believe in the subject and talk?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the proposal clear? Don&amp;rsquo;t make me second-guess you. It&amp;rsquo;s a red flag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the title magnetic?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the summary/abstract to-the-point?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to decide: &lt;em&gt;when an audience member scans the
program, are they going to understand clearly what this person wants to present,
and will they want to go to this talk? and if they do go, am I confident they
will have a good experience?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also things I try &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; to do, as a reviewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do not judge you, personally. Oh, okay, I&amp;rsquo;m biased &amp;ndash; everyone is biased.
It&amp;rsquo;s true. But I try not to think about &amp;ldquo;John is a good speaker and he&amp;rsquo;s
really smart and knows a lot about this.&amp;rdquo; Not usually, anyway. Some speakers
are engaging and I know that. Their audience is going to have a great time
and come away talking about that session. I keep that in mind, sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do not try to agree or disagree with you. I am not going to &amp;ldquo;legislate from
the bench.&amp;rdquo; If that were my job, the conference&amp;rsquo;s content would be much less
diverse. I will try to rate your proposal based on how strong it is, not on
whether I think you&amp;rsquo;re wrong. It bothers me a little when I see other
reviewers rating talks like &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve used technology X and it was not good, so
I&amp;rsquo;m going to vote down this proposal about how great it is.&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t do that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my take-aways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your proposal speak to the committee. Understand that they are reading
hundreds of proposals as fast as they can.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make your title speak to the audience. Get them in the room. You have
approximately seven words to do that. Don&amp;rsquo;t waste any of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to write a short, pithy blog post about this, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough
time, so I wrote a long rambling one instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry about that.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I need help. I&amp;rsquo;m giving an Ignite talk at &lt;a href=&#34;http://velocityconf.com/velocityeu2014/&#34;&gt;Velocity
EU&lt;/a&gt; that involves a guitar. I
don&amp;rsquo;t want to bring a guitar all the way from America just for this. Would you
please loan me one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/4542297929_49286da35a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;guitar&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be anything special &amp;ndash; any old classical or acoustic 6-string
standard guitar will do. All I&amp;rsquo;m going to do is tune it.&lt;br /&gt;
If you can bring a guitar to loan me, please post in the comments or give me a
shout on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/xaprb&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://velocityconf.com&#34;&gt;O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Velocity&lt;/a&gt; is November 17-19 in Barcelona. O’Reilly gave me a 2-day pass to give away, and I decided to have some fun with it. We’re also giving away a pass on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://vividcortex.com/blog/2014/10/30/win-a-free-pass-to-velocity-barcelona/&#34;&gt;VividCortex blog&lt;/a&gt;, so you can double your odds of winning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For your chance to win a 2-day pass, do one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answer any of the following questions; or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a haiku that’s somehow relevant to Velocity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tweet your answers to @xaprb with #velocitytrivia. You can find the answers to the questions on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://velocityconf.com&#34;&gt;velocityconf.com&lt;/a&gt; website. Speed and accuracy is your friend in this game, as answers will not be accepted after November 6. I’ll announce the winner November 7. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q.1: Which sessions are about anomaly detection? Make sure you look for one that doesn’t have “anomaly” in the title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q.2: Which session (link to it) might help you avoid cognitive traps?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q.3: Which session (link to it) is absolutely swimming in puns?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q.4:What are the “five reasons” to come to Velocity? Bolded reasons are fine. (hint, reading About Velocity will help)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q.5: Which Velocity EU Event gives you 5 minutes to get on stage and talk your latest passion, idea or hack?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q.6: Who’s going to get up on stage and use math and physics to tune a musical instrument, and what does that have to do with web performance and operations?&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Join me and other &lt;a href=&#34;http://velocityconf.com/&#34;&gt;Velocity&lt;/a&gt; attendees during the Wednesday afternoon 2:40pm break for a 10-15 minute guided meditation session appropriate for people of any faith or of none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation has a host of scientifically proven immediate and long-term benefits. If you get an extra 10% of clarity and effectiveness for the rest of the afternoon, you&amp;rsquo;ll end up learning more and making your conference experience more worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/06/stones.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;meditation&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll guide you through a process of checking in and becoming aware of your body and mind. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll let the body rest until we come back for it, while we turn our attention to the breath for a few minutes. During this time we&amp;rsquo;ll notice and be gently curious about thoughts and feelings that spontaneously arise. Then we&amp;rsquo;ll bring our attention back to our bodies and senses, and finish with a few deep breaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This practice is easy and nonjudgmental. Your mileage may vary, but I find that I&amp;rsquo;m able to take the resulting sense of calm and clarity with me into my other activities afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll begin at 3pm sharp, so please arrive a few minutes early. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet finalized the meeting location. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/xaprb&#34;&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and when I settle on a good location, I&amp;rsquo;ll announce it. Retweet my announcement if you plan to join us, so I have a sense of how much room we&amp;rsquo;ll need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to add this to your Google Calendar, here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a target=&#34;_blank&#34; href=&#34;https://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&amp;tmeid=djBmbGRuM2RhZm5rMjBwazc4Yml2b2RjOTAgYmFyb25Adml2aWRjb3J0ZXguY29t&amp;tmsrc=baron%40vividcortex.com&#34;&gt;link to an event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Two of My Favorite Conferences: Velocity and Surge</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Two of my favorite conferences are coming up. One&amp;rsquo;s just next week, and
another&amp;rsquo;s in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;velocity&#34;&gt;Velocity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7094008-11742203&#34;&gt;Velocity&lt;/a&gt; is such a great event.
I wanted to go for years, and when I finally did it was honestly one of the
highlights of my professional career. I still don&amp;rsquo;t know what I did get get
invited to speak that first year. It was a golden horseshoe falling out of the
sky and landing right in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/06/velocity.png&#34; alt=&#34;Velocity&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not the talks (though those are great). It&amp;rsquo;s the people. The people
at Velocity are the people I want to spend my career with, the people thinking
about the same types of problems I am, the people trying to work on similar
solutions. They&amp;rsquo;re building companies, they&amp;rsquo;re making open source, they&amp;rsquo;re
customers, they&amp;rsquo;re consultants, they&amp;rsquo;re just passionate practitioners. It&amp;rsquo;s just
amazing what happens when this kind of group gets together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s partially because I&amp;rsquo;m a loyal O&amp;rsquo;Reilly fan. I admit it: I love
O&amp;rsquo;Reilly, I truly do. It&amp;rsquo;s a remarkable group of people that has inspired me for
more than a decade, and I owe a lot of who I am to O&amp;rsquo;Reilly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Velocity starts next Tuesday in Santa Clara. If you don&amp;rsquo;t go to that one,
there&amp;rsquo;s several other incarnations in New York, Barcelona, and Beijing at
different times of the year. I&amp;rsquo;ll be in Santa Clara next week, in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://vividcortex.com/&#34;&gt;VividCortex&lt;/a&gt; booth. Come say hi if you&amp;rsquo;re there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an affiliate link that has a 20% discount code embedded in it:
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kqzyfj.com/click-7094008-11742203&#34;&gt;Velocity AFF20&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;surge&#34;&gt;Surge&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve often said that &lt;a href=&#34;http://surge.omniti.com/&#34;&gt;Surge&lt;/a&gt; is Velocity without the grandiosity and with more
emphasis on hardcore software and systems engineering &amp;mdash; and a much smaller
price tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/06/surge.png&#34; alt=&#34;Surge&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been at every Surge event since the beginning, and I would not miss it.
It&amp;rsquo;s that good. I can say all the same things about Surge as I can about
Velocity, except it&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier and less expensive to get to, and it&amp;rsquo;s a lot
easier to decide to attend the talks there. At Velocity sometimes I feel lost
because the event is so big, and I end up not really attending many
presentations, and just hanging out in the hallway track. Not so at Surge.
Bonus: talks are always recorded and online, so you can go find out for yourself
how good they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The climate at Surge is also quite different in terms of the topics. Velocity is
ostensibly about the Web: backend, frontend, browser, and mobile are front and
center. As a result, you can certainly find yourself in an unfamiliar clique, if
you&amp;rsquo;re, say, a database administrator at a lunch table full of people who want to
argue about how much hardware acceleration will save battery life in a mobile
browser. Whether that bothers you or not is up to you, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found that Surge
is birds of my feather for sure. It&amp;rsquo;s all about people who build what runs the
Internet (not necessarily what you use to engage with the Internet).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty loyal to the folks behind Surge, too. For one thing, a lot of them
are the same people who make Velocity awesome. For another, many of them have
helped me tremendously in my career and in founding VividCortex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surge is in early-bird pricing right now. Having run conferences before, I know
why early-bird pricing exists. If you think you&amp;rsquo;ll attend, do yourself and them
a favor and sign up at a discount now. Here, click &lt;a href=&#34;http://surge.omniti.com/2014&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no conclusions. Conferences are good. I love Velocity. I love Surge.
Go. Learn a lot. Share a lot. Make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Monitorama 2014 Portland has been a great show. I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed the technical
nature of the talks, the diversity of the speakers, the topics from hilarious to
thought-provoking, and the stage in a theater, set up for a Shakespearean
tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also taken a lot of notes. For example, Toufic from Metafor Software
suggested that the audience look into the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. I am proud of
the slide that made its way into my talk as a result:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/05/smirnov.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Smirnov&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My slides are embedded below. Enjoy. I&amp;rsquo;ve also uploaded an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/05/time-series-tricks.xlsx&#34;&gt;Excel spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; you
can use to tinker with the math and reproduce my results. Let me know if I did
anything wrong, please!&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Freeing some Velocity videos</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Following my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2013/10/24/should-velocity-videos-be-free/&#34; title=&#34;Should Velocity videos be free?&#34;&gt;previous post on Velocity videos&lt;/a&gt;, I had some private email conversations with good folks at O&amp;rsquo;Reilly, and a really nice in-person exchange with a top-level person as well. I was surprised to hear them encourage me to publish my videos online freely!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still believe that nothing substitutes for the experience of attending an O&amp;rsquo;Reilly conference in-person, but I&amp;rsquo;ll also be the first to admit that my talks are usually more conceptual and academic than practical, and designed to start a conversation rather than to tell you the Truth According To Baron. Thus, I think they&amp;rsquo;re worth sharing more widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O&amp;rsquo;Reilly alleviated my concerns about &amp;ldquo;killing the golden goose,&amp;rdquo; but I like one person&amp;rsquo;s take on the cost of O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s conferences. &amp;ldquo;You think education is expensive? Try ignorance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll post some of my past talks soon for your enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most valuable life skills you can ever develop is to overcome the urge to stay within your comfort zone. If you stay where you&amp;rsquo;re familiar and feel safe, two things might happen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might find out that it&amp;rsquo;s not safe after all. Bad things can happen where you feel at home just as well as out of the familar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nothing good will happen. You might skate through life without even living it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week at Velocity I responded to an invitation from O&amp;rsquo;Reilly to join a lunch with Per Scholas. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know much about Per Scholas, but I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to say yes to invitations from O&amp;rsquo;Reilly. The night before, I watched an inspiring &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0qcDwDPQ-Q&#34;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; during Ignite, from the founder of Per Scholas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Impressed, I began to really look forward to spending some time with the Per Scholas folks the next day at lunch. The idea was pretty simple: people who were working through the Per Scholas training would pair up one-for-one (as I understand it) with people like myself &amp;ndash; technologists, entrepreneurs, hackers, makers, people with perhaps something to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I sat down at a table in the designated area, leaving lots of room beside me for people to join. None of the Per Scholas students was there yet. I chatted idly with two other people at the table. Soon one of the Per Scholas staff members sat down with us. I asked her a series of questions for ten minutes or so. She explained that she helped people with basic life and work skills, coaching and mentoring even after they leave the intensive study program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still no students had joined us. Suddenly I looked over at another table and saw that it had filled entirely with Per Scholas students, shoulder to shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Basic life skill number 1 is to build your network and learn from unfamiliar people,&amp;rdquo; I remarked to the staffer next to me. &amp;ldquo;They are missing an opportunity to mingle with us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; she answered. &amp;ldquo;They are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then you could (metaphorically) hear the crickets chirping. I finished my lunch and left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t brag about myself, but I can say that the other people at that table were damn sure worth getting to know. As for me, I considered it a complete waste of my time; I&amp;rsquo;d chosen it over a conversation I really wanted to attend elsewhere. There&amp;rsquo;s another blog post in here somewhere &amp;ndash; this isn&amp;rsquo;t the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had this kind of experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Per Scholas students aren&amp;rsquo;t paying anything (financially) for their training. Are they getting what they&amp;rsquo;re paying for? You bet they are. Like all of us, they will get out of it exactly what they put into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get out of your comfort zone. If you don&amp;rsquo;t, the worst thing in the world happens to you: &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Should Velocity videos be free?</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2013/10/24/should-velocity-videos-be-free/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 24 Oct 2013 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2013/10/24/should-velocity-videos-be-free/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;At the closing keynote of the recent Velocity conference in New York, an audience member stepped up to the microphone and called for O&amp;rsquo;Reilly to provide videos of the event free to the public, instead of behind a paywall. The conference chairs, who don&amp;rsquo;t call the shots on such matters, squirmed and looked at the person who does call the shots, a few feet away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone volunteered the information that speakers are able to download their own talks and post them freely if they wish. The original commenter then asked the audience, which presumably included most of the speakers, to do so en masse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a speaker, frequent conference-goer, author, technologist, and even a sometimes-organizer of such events, I can&amp;rsquo;t say I agree with this suggestion. I think it&amp;rsquo;s self-defeating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commenter&amp;rsquo;s request was prefaced by something to the effect of &amp;ldquo;we should open up all this great content and thought-provoking conversation more widely.&amp;rdquo; But I think that sometimes, you gotta want something badly enough to pay for it, even if it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s a shame to ask people to pay for access to the club that makes the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s numbers, but I know conferences are a tough business. O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s in an even tougher industry in general &amp;ndash; publishing. Much of the thought leadership at events like Velocity comes from the authors, editors, bloggers, and other communicators of technical and cultural excellence. Most of these people have worked really hard for comparatively little financial reward. I never got the impression that my editor Andy Oram, who is really dedicated to his life&amp;rsquo;s passion, is a rich man. I would be surprised if O&amp;rsquo;Reilly is raking in the cash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The videos of the content are, as I understand, quite lucrative for O&amp;rsquo;Reilly. Maybe O&amp;rsquo;Reilly could consider something like making videos of conferences free after a couple of years when they&amp;rsquo;re selling less actively, but those videos are probably a big part of what makes Velocity possible &amp;ndash; and sustains their business overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Velocity conference, and those like it, is a venue for changing the world. I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed it time and time again. The network that lives in and around the conferences, publishing, blogging, and so on is a symbiotic ecosystem. It&amp;rsquo;s all a very real part of O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s mission to &amp;ldquo;spread the knowledge of innovators.&amp;rdquo; I know I sound like a shill, but seriously, not many organizations do what O&amp;rsquo;Reilly does, and you can&amp;rsquo;t undercut them without broad consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s not kill the golden goose. If you think the videos are valuable, great. Tell people they&amp;rsquo;re worth paying for. Better yet &amp;ndash; put your money where your mouth is and show up at the conference yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt; Just to clarify, I&amp;rsquo;m not advocating for O&amp;rsquo;Reilly to remove the freedom for speakers to do as they see fit with their own videos. I just don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s a good thing if every speaker decides to post the video just to make an end run around O&amp;rsquo;Reilly&amp;rsquo;s policy en masse. John Allspaw said it well in an email to me: &amp;ldquo;You think education is expensive? Try ignorance!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2013/08/18/speaking-at-percona-university-sept-12th/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be joining Percona for a free day of MySQL education and insight at their upcoming &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.percona.com/news-and-events/percona-university/washington-dc&#34;&gt;Percona University Washington DC event on September 12th&lt;/a&gt;. My topic is accessing MySQL from Google&amp;rsquo;s Go programming language. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot about this over the past year or so, and hopefully I can help you get a quick-start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Go, it&amp;rsquo;s the darling of the Hacker News crowd these days. Anything with &amp;ldquo;Go&amp;rdquo; in its title gets to the front page for at least a little while! Go is a great systems programming language. It&amp;rsquo;s safe to say I&amp;rsquo;ve fallen in love with it, and it&amp;rsquo;s now my favorite programming language of all those I&amp;rsquo;ve used over my entire career. I chose it because it&amp;rsquo;s ideally suited for VividCortex&amp;rsquo;s agent programs (zero dependencies, compiled, lightweight, high performance, robust, makes concurrency easy and safe), and we&amp;rsquo;re using it for our API servers and backend processing jobs for many of the same reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of great content at these free Percona University events. If you&amp;rsquo;re not near Washington DC, you should sign up for Percona&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.percona.com/subscribe&#34;&gt;conferences and training newsletter&lt;/a&gt; so you find out about the next one near you.&lt;/p&gt;

          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2013/08/18/speaking-at-strata-nyc-making-big-data-small/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2013 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2013/08/18/speaking-at-strata-nyc-making-big-data-small/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m off to my first &lt;a href=&#34;http://strataconf.com/stratany2013/&#34;&gt;Strata&lt;/a&gt; conference, and I&amp;rsquo;m speaking! I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to attend Strata. (OSCON too, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet made it there.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My session will be about &lt;a href=&#34;http://strataconf.com/stratany2013/public/schedule/detail/31435&#34;&gt;ways to make big data small&lt;/a&gt;, in both the storage and processing dimensions, without losing much of the value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2013/08/4985831624_fc6cc446c9-300x156.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;4985831624_fc6cc446c9&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;156&#34; class=&#34;aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3248&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with Bloom Filters, this is an example. Bloom Filters let you answer the question,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is value X a member of this data set? Yes, or no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by substituting the question,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is value X a member of this data set? Probably yes, or definitely no?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You lose a small and quantifiable amount of precision in the &amp;ldquo;yes,&amp;rdquo; and you gain massive savings in storage and processing cost. Bloom Filters are typically used when you need a definite answer, but only as a pre-filtering step, because if the answer happens to be No, you save the effort of looking through the set to try to find your data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That worldview or philosophy is a valuable thing to keep in your pocket when you&amp;rsquo;re working with large amounts of data, and that&amp;rsquo;s the topic of my Strata Conference / Hadoop World NYC 2013 talk.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>My recipe for more enjoyable presentations</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2013/07/02/my-recipe-for-more-enjoyable-presentations/</link>
          <pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2013 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2013/07/02/my-recipe-for-more-enjoyable-presentations/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I started making my presentations more beautiful, people have often asked me my secret. It&amp;rsquo;s not a secret, and it&amp;rsquo;s really quite simple to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, realize that it&amp;rsquo;s not about you. It&amp;rsquo;s about your audience. Now, get &lt;em&gt;and read&lt;/em&gt; a few good books on presentations. Your presentations, and your presentation skills, need to be good. You can&amp;rsquo;t just make things beautiful to compensate for badness in other areas. This is something I&amp;rsquo;m always working on. (On the other hand, many a great presenter has doomed him/herself with awful slides.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My list of recommended books includes those from Nancy Duarte, especially &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/slide-ology-Science-Creating-Presentations/dp/0596522347/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;Slide:ology&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Resonate-Present-Stories-Transform-Audiences/dp/0470632011/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;Resonate&lt;/a&gt;. I have also found &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/TJ-Walkers-Secret-Foolproof-Presentations/dp/1929774885/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Public-Speaker-English/dp/1449301959/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; really helpful. Some of these I found in the airport, of all places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, develop great content, and practice it. See the books above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, use a good professionally-designed template. Pay $30 for crying out loud. Are you a graphic designer? No? How much is your time worth? I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.keynotepro.com/&#34;&gt;bought Keynote templates from Keynote Pro&lt;/a&gt; among other places. I&amp;rsquo;ve also hired people to help build custom slides for important talks, such as keynote addresses at major conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, and this is the part I enjoy the most: I rarely put text alone on a slide. I&amp;rsquo;ll almost always choose a master that has space for a little text (and I usually try to use only a few words) and an image. I&amp;rsquo;ll emphasize this: use only a couple of words on the slides. The words on the slide should cue you, if necessary, to remember what to talk about. For the audience, they should convey the overall theme &amp;ndash; think of it as hashtags &amp;ndash; of the things you&amp;rsquo;re talking about now. Do not put the full content on the slides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I find an image that seems to fit. My favorite way to do this is a Flickr search for CC-licensed content, sorted by interestingness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Chrome, I use a custom search engine. The keyword is &amp;ldquo;f&amp;rdquo; and the URL pattern is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=%s&amp;#038;l=cc&amp;#038;ct=0&amp;#038;mt=photos&amp;#038;adv=1&amp;#038;s=int
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try it. Here&amp;rsquo;s a Flickr search for &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=heart&amp;amp;#038;l=cc&amp;amp;#038;ct=0&amp;amp;#038;mt=photos&amp;amp;#038;adv=1&amp;amp;#038;s=int&#34;&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt;, for example. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that a beautiful page full of images?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if your slides are a boring template, and your talk isn&amp;rsquo;t that great, and your presentation skills aren&amp;rsquo;t that polished, your audience will automatically find your talk much more pleasant now. And it&amp;rsquo;s all about your audience. Remember that!&lt;/p&gt;

The talk explained how we use exponentially weighted moving statistics to generate a meta-metric of abnormality for the time-series metrics measured from MySQL. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of a mouthful. Maybe you had to be there :-)&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/events/io/sessions/332768653&#34;&gt;35-minute video&lt;/a&gt; from the recent Google I/O conference explains how to use Go&amp;rsquo;s concurrency primitives &amp;ndash; goroutines, channels, and the &lt;code&gt;select&lt;/code&gt; statement &amp;ndash; to do things elegantly, correctly, and safely in a few lines of Go, which would otherwise turn your brain into a pretzel in most programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite thing about Go is that a good Go program looks self-evident and obvious, even when it may be doing things that would be insanely complex in another language. Callbacks, closures, mutexes, and so on just disappear, and the program itself emerges, looking completely unimpressive. In many cases I think &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s the big deal about that?&amp;rdquo; until I realize how hard it would be to write in Java, or Perl, or so on. A lot of the code in Percona Toolkit, for example, involved &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~percona-toolkit-dev/percona-toolkit/2.1/view/head:/bin/pt-query-digest#L11835&#34;&gt;pipelines&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; of callbacks passing data along to other callbacks for further processing. These were hard to reason about, hard to make resilient to errors and allow clean termination, and were redesigned several times, never very successfully in my opinion. In Go, channels make those kinds of tasks so simple. Such a program in Go looks suspiciously like a Unix | pipe | and | filter | program. If you think about it, the Unix shell itself is a great example of using &amp;ldquo;channels&amp;rdquo; successfully to trivialize what would otherwise be a migraine-inducing task.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Two upcoming Go-related talks I&#39;m giving</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m scheduled to talk about Go a couple times in the upcoming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is May 4th in Arlington at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dayoffosterly.com/&#34;&gt;A Day Of Foster.ly&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ll be a participant in a panel titled &lt;em&gt;Add To Your Programming Toolkit: Languages You Should Know About (Erlang, Clojure, R, Go, etc&amp;hellip;)&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about Go, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second May 7th is at my local technology guild, the &lt;a href=&#34;http://neonguild.org/&#34;&gt;Neon Guild&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be giving a &amp;ldquo;gentle introduction&amp;rdquo; to Go. I&amp;rsquo;ve been programming in Go for less than a year, so my first impressions are still fresh. If you are in the Charlottesville area and you haven&amp;rsquo;t been to a Neon Guild meeting, do yourself a favor and show up. It&amp;rsquo;s free and no RSVP is required. Description:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that every time I tell someone we&amp;rsquo;ve chosen Go as our primary language at VividCortex, they respond with something like &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve heard about Go! Neat! What is it like? Why did you choose it? Are you happy with it?&amp;rdquo; The answer is that Go is a fascinating language that&amp;rsquo;s working great for us. After many years of programming in everything from C to Java to C# to Perl to LISP to Shell, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty much in love with Go. There are particular reasons I chose it for our special use case, but beyond just niche considerations, it&amp;rsquo;s working great as a general-purpose, high-performance, very productive systems language. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to contain my enthusiasm and tell a story about evaluating it, learning it, and then learning it more deeply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope to see you at one of these events. If you see me, wave and introduce yourself, and give me a business card so I can &lt;s&gt;stalk&lt;/s&gt; connect with you on LinkedIn!&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I was a guest on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://foodfightshow.org/2013/03/adaptive-fault-detection.html&#34;&gt;Food Fight Show&lt;/a&gt; last week, along with a bevy of really smart people asking and answering tough questions on fault detection. We didn&amp;rsquo;t talk a lot about MySQL, but given that &lt;a href=&#34;https://vividcortex.com/&#34;&gt;VividCortex&lt;/a&gt; is focusing on MySQL initially, pretty much all of my experience with zero-threshold, zero-configuration fault detection is MySQL-based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a fun conversation with a lot of insights into the industry, what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with current monitoring tools, and where monitoring is going. Also, it&amp;rsquo;s sold out now, but &lt;a href=&#34;http://monitorama.com/&#34;&gt;Monitorama&lt;/a&gt; is a conference you might be interested in if you&amp;rsquo;re doing monitoring (and who isn&amp;rsquo;t?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a collection of upcoming events that are interesting to me as a MySQL user (in some cases because I&amp;rsquo;m speaking). I think some of them are must-see events. I am sure I am missing a lot of events, but some of these are only publicized in specific channels, and I wanted to mention them here to help spread the word.&lt;/p&gt;
