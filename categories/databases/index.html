        <span class="post-date">Sun, Dec 6, 2015</span>
        <p>I often see benchmark reports that show charts but don&rsquo;t provide tables of
numeric results. Some people will make the actual measurements available if
asked, but I&rsquo;ve been interested in
<a href="https://www.vividcortex.com/resources/universal-scalability-law/">analyzing</a>
many systems for which I can&rsquo;t get numbers.  Fortunately, it&rsquo;s usually possible
to get approximate results without too much trouble. In this blog post I&rsquo;ll show
several ways to extract estimates of values from a chart image.</p>

        <p>In the last couple of weeks, there have been a few blog posts about benchmarks
comparing the performance of various versions of MySQL and variants such as
MariaDB. There&rsquo;s also been some analysis of the results using formal models such
as Neil Gunther&rsquo;s Universal Scalability Law.</p>

<p>What can the Universal Scalability Law (USL) teach us about the performance
characteristics of these systems, as revealed by the benchmarks? To find out,
I&rsquo;ll examine one particular benchmark, <a href="https://blog.mariadb.org/maria-10-1-mysql-5-7-commodity-hardware/">MariaDB 10.1 and MySQL 5.7 performance
on commodity hardware</a>.</p>

        <p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard about <a href="http://www.pgconfsv.com/">PGConfSV</a> yet, it&rsquo;s a
conference for the Silicon Valley PostgreSQL community and beyond, featuring
leading PostgreSQL performance and scalability experts. It&rsquo;s happening November
17-18 at the South San Francisco Conference Center. I encourage everyone in the
area to attend, since this is likely to be the best Postgres conference held
thus far in the Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>I also urge you to <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pgconf-silicon-valley-2015-tickets-16521286613">buy your tickets</a> before they sell out! Of course, the earlier
you buy, the more you save, too. (Use SeeMeSpeak for a 20% discount).</p>

<p><img src="/media/2015/10/ssfcc.jpg" alt="Convention Center" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be at the conference along with some of my colleagues. I&rsquo;m pretty excited
about this for a few reasons. Allow me to &lsquo;splain why?</p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Oct 16, 2015</span>
        <p>A while ago I wrote a blog post about <a href="/blog/2014/06/08/time-series-database-requirements/">time series database
requirements</a> that has been
amazingly popular. Somewhere close to a dozen companies have told me they&rsquo;ve
built custom in-house time series databases, and that blog post was the first
draft of a design document for it.</p>

<p>One of the things I said in the post was that I had no use for the &ldquo;tagging&rdquo;
functionality I&rsquo;ve seen in time series databases such as OpenTSDB. I&rsquo;ve since
reconsidered, although I think the functionality I now want is a bit different.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Aug 8, 2015</span>
        <p>Years ago I pursued my interest in InnoDB&rsquo;s architecture and design, and became impressed with its sophistication. Another way to say it is that <a href="/blog/2014/12/08/eventual-consistency-simpler-than-mvcc/">InnoDB is complicated, as are all MVCC databases</a>. However, InnoDB manages to hide the bulk of its complexity entirely from most users.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2015/08/iceberg.jpg" alt="Iceberg" /></p>

<p>I decided to at least outline a book on InnoDB. After researching it for a while, it became clear that it would need to be a series of books in multiple volumes, with somewhere between 1000 and 2000 pages total.</p>

<p>At one time I actually understood a lot of this material, but I have forgotten most of it now.</p>

<p>I did not begin writing. Although it is incomplete, outdated, and in some cases wrong, I share the outline here in case anyone is interested. It might be of particular interest to someone who thinks it&rsquo;s an easy task to write a new database.</p>

        <p>Database performance optimization is usually a topic concerned with indexes, SQL
design, lock contention, and the like. But the real database bottleneck is the
siloed culture that accretes around the database and has secondary and tertiary
effects that are far more pernicious than you might think. The real opportunity
in database optimization is the interplay between the technology and the
organization, and its communication structures.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Mon, May 25, 2015</span>
        <p>Many database vendors would like me to take a look at their products and
consider adopting them for all sorts of purposes. Often they&rsquo;re pitching
something quite new and unproven as a replacement for mature, boring technology
I&rsquo;m using happily.</p>

<p>I would consider a new and unproven technology, and I often have. As I&rsquo;ve
written previously, though, <a href="/blog/2014/06/08/time-series-database-requirements/">a real evaluation takes a lot of
effort</a>, and that
makes most evaluations non-starters.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important thing I&rsquo;m considering is whether the product is
mature. There are different levels of maturity, naturally, but I want to
understand whether it&rsquo;s mature enough for me to take a look at it. And in that
spirit, it&rsquo;s worth understanding what makes a database mature.</p>

        <p>This should sound familiar:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the great lies about NoSQL databases is that they&rsquo;re simple. Simplicity
done wrong makes things a lot harder and more complicated to develop and
operate. Programmers and operations staff end up reimplementing (badly) things
the database should do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody argued this line of reasoning more vigorously than when trying to defend
relational databases, especially during the darkest years (ca.  2009-2010), when
NoSQL still meant <strong>NO SQL DAMMIT</strong>, all sorts of NoSQL databases were
sprouting, and most of them were massively overhyped.  But as valid as those
arguments against NoSQL&rsquo;s &ldquo;false economy&rdquo; simplicity were and are, the arguments
against relational databases&rsquo; complexity hold true, too.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve had conversations about time-series databases with many people over the last couple of years. I <a href="/blog/2014/03/02/time-series-databases-influxdb/">wrote previously</a> about some of the open-source technologies that people commonly use for time-series storage.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/06/timeseries.jpg" alt="Time Series" /></p>

<p>Because I have my own ideas about what constitutes a good time-series database, and because a few people have asked me to describe my requirements, I have decided to publish my thoughts here. All opinions that follow are my own, and as you read you should mentally add &ldquo;in my opinion&rdquo; to every sentence.</p>

        <p>A while ago I <a href="/blog/2012/04/24/the-mysql-init-script-mess/">wrote</a> about some of the things that can make MySQL unreliable or hard to operate. Some time after that, in a completely unrelated topic, someone made me aware of a set of principles called <a href="http://12factor.net">12-factor</a> that I believe originated from experiences building Heroku.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/05/dodecahedron.jpg" alt="Dodecahedron" /></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s been over a year, and I&rsquo;ve come to increasingly agree with the 12-factor principles. I guess I&rsquo;m extremely late to the party, but making applications behave in 12-factor-compliant ways has solved a lot of problems for me.</p>

<p>This experience has repeatedly reminded me of one of the applications that continues to cause a lot of the kinds of pain that the 12-factor principles have solved for me: MySQL.</p>

        If you&rsquo;re interested in Google&rsquo;s Go programming language, perhaps you aren&rsquo;t sure what drivers to use for MySQL. The good news is there are excellent drivers for MySQL.
There are several opensource ones on GitHub and elsewhere, but the driver I recommend is https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/. Why?
 It is pure Go, not a wrapper around a C library, and is liberally licensed. It is high performance. A lot of work has gone into making it avoid allocations and consume minimal CPU.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 28, 2014</span>
        <p>I was listening to a conversation recently and heard an experienced engineer express an interesting point of view on joins and key-value databases. I don&rsquo;t entirely agree with it. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/04/loc.jpg" alt="Library Of Congress" /></p>

<p>First, the opinion. If I may paraphrase, the discussion was something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>With experience in building distributed systems, one learns to avoid JOIN.</li>
<li>Therefore, much of the work of JOIN is done in the application instead of the database.</li>
<li>Access to the database is usually reduced to simple primary-key lookups.</li>
<li>Therefore, a key-value store is as good a choice as a relational database.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m simplifying, because the speaker actually suggested that MySQL makes a really good database for primary-key lookups as well.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 21, 2014</span>
        <p>Have you heard of <em>sharding</em> a database? Of course you have. Do you know where
the term comes from? Someone asked me this at a cocktail party recently. I gave
it my best shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The earliest I remember was Google engineers using it to describe the
architecture of some things,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That would have been about 2006.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope. Much earlier than that,&rdquo; said my new friend.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/04/ultima.jpg" alt="ultima" /></p>

<p>I pondered. &ldquo;Well, I guess there was the famous LiveJournal architecture
article about MySQL. That was, I dunno, 2003?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The person then told me the following history. I can neither
confirm nor deny it; what do you know about it?</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Apr 13, 2014</span>
        Embedded below are slides for the two talks I gave at Percona Live. The first one is titled knowing the unknowable. It illustrates the special regression technique we developed at VividCortex for computing the amount of CPU, IO, or other resources a query uses within MySQL.
 The second one is on building MySQL database applications with Go.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Apr 12, 2014</span>
        I was interested to see the announcement of a MySQL replication synchronization checker utility from Oracle recently. Readers may know that I spent years working on this problem. The tool is now known as pt-table-checksum in Percona Toolkit, but the original work started in 2006. I would say that I personally have spent at least 6 months working on that; adding up all the other Percona Toolkit developers, there might be several man-years of work invested.
