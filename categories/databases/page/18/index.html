        If you&rsquo;d like some improvements to the Cacti templates (MySQL, Apache, Memcached, and more) I&rsquo;ve been maintaining, please make your voice heard &ndash; either write to the mailing list, or post a new issue (or comment on an existing one) on the issue list. I&rsquo;ve got a bunch of work underway, including a test suite for ss_get_by_ssh.php.
 VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Dec 25, 2009</span>
        MySQL has a couple of sanity-check features to help keep you from doing dumb things.
 max_join_size is a configuration option for the mysqld server program. It throws an error if you write a query that the optimizer estimates will examine more than this number of rows. &#8211;safe-updates is a command-line option to the mysql client program. It throws an error if you write an UPDATE or DELETE without a) a WHERE clause that refers to an indexed column or b) a LIMIT clause.

        I&rsquo;m on the MySQL conference committee again this year, so I&rsquo;ll be reading and voting on your session proposals. My past experience is that reading 400 session proposals is a mind-numbing job, and I will be optimizing it to save my time. That means I will be scanning your proposals and deciding very quickly how to vote. I wrote before about how to submit a great proposal, but I&rsquo;ve refined my opinion since then.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 14, 2009</span>
        One of MySQL&rsquo;s notable projects was splitting the product into two editions: Enterprise Edition and Community Edition. This move alienated many in the community, and failed to create meaningful differentiation on either side, even with a team of people beating the community bushes for &ldquo;contributions.&rdquo; The net differentiation was ultimately Jeremy Cole&rsquo;s SHOW PROFILES functionality, which made Community better than Enterprise. Sun put less effort into making this split work, and eventually they abandoned it.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Dec 13, 2009</span>
        As long as the whole world is chasing this meaningless &ldquo;NoSQL&rdquo; buzzword, we should recognize that InnoDB is usable as an embedded database without an SQL interface. Hence, it is as much of a NoSQL database as anything else labeled with that term. And I might add, it is fast, reliable, and extremely well-tested in the real world. How many NoSQL databases have protection against partial page writes, for example?

One of the bug fixes prevents spikes in graphs, but requires you to rebuild your RRD files. There are upgrade instructions on the project wiki for this and all releases. Use the project issue tracker to view and report issues, and use the project mailing list to discuss the templates and scripts.

 Innobase could therefore have provided an enhanced version of InnoDB, like Oracle&rsquo;s current InnoDB+, under non-GPL license, &hellip;
 I don&rsquo;t know anything more.

        The best overall method of performance optimization is optimization for response time. Users care about response time, not load average or cache hit ratios. The job of a system is to accept some request and do the required work, and deliver a result. The time elapsed between the request and the result is the response time.
Methods of Response Time Optimization Not all optimization methods are created equal. Here are a few I see commonly.

        If you haven&rsquo;t seen it, Josh Berkus has a very concise way to look at the confusing mess that is database &ldquo;clustering&rdquo; from the point of view of three distinct types of users: transactional, analytic, and online. I think that using this kind of distinction could help keep discussions clear &ndash; I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of conversations around clustering run off the rails due to disagreements about what clustering means. MySQL Cluster, for example, is a huge red herring for a lot of people, but it seems to be a difficult process to learn it well enough to decide.

        Ever been around a group of people discussing some technology and heard Cool-Whip phrases like this?
 It&rsquo;s not about MySQL versus PostgreSQL, it&rsquo;s about using the right tool for the job.
 Or how about this one?
 You need to take the important factors into account before you decide whether [hot new fad] or [trusty old solution] is best suited for your application.
 Both are signs that someone might be trying to sound important.

        I was at OpenSQL Camp 2009 in Portland last weekend. I thought the event was very well done. On Friday we had a pizza party at Old Town Pizza, which was awesome. Saturday and Sunday were breakfast, sessions, lunch (yum), and sessions and hacking. These were held at souk, a co-working space. After 5PM, people got together for dinner, beer, etc.
I presented on mk-query-digest &ndash; a live demo of features requested by the audience.

        Last week I attended the Enterprise LAMP Summit and Camp in Nashville, Tennessee. I enjoyed the event and met or reconnected with a lot of great people. I was glad to be able to spend time with some folks from the Postgres community. My own sessions focused on MySQL.
During the Summit I tried to help people understand how to think about performance, and made the case that the Percona versions of the MySQL server are not only the highest-performance available, but uniquely provide the instrumentation necessary to follow a disciplined performance optimization process such as Method R or Goal-Driven Performance Optimization.

        You used to use mk-query-digest to aggregate and report on MySQL&rsquo;s slow query log. Then it got the ability to grab query events from polling SHOW PROCESSLIST. Next we thought, really, how hard can it be to implement the libmysql wire protocol, so we can sniff TCP packets? &hellip; it&rsquo;s hard, but not that hard as it turns out. But why stop there, why not implement memcached protocol too? I think you can see where this is headed.

        MySQL Proxy is a really neat tool. I remember a few years back when I first saw Jan talking about it. Back in those days it was significantly different than it is now, but the concept remains the same: direct your database traffic through a man-in-the-middle. Chris Calender&rsquo;s post on capturing erroneous queries with MySQL Proxy shows one use for Proxy. But wait. MySQL Proxy is just inspecting the MySQL protocol.
