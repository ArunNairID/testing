        <span class="post-date">Wed, Nov 29, 2006</span>
        I wrote a while ago about a program I wrote to export GnuCash data into a MySQL database, including a couple of queries against the resulting schema. I&rsquo;ve made some improvements since then to allow a simple overlay of my wife&rsquo;s categories onto the GnuCash hierarchy. This article explains the improved schema, and includes some more useful tools and queries.
The improved schema The heart of the schema that holds the GnuCash data remains the same, but I&rsquo;ve added a table to overlay our categorization system onto it.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Nov 28, 2006</span>
        Here&rsquo;s a way to write join clauses so they are more compact, more readable, and less confusing.
Standard SQL:2003 defines a USING clause that can serve the same function as the ON clause in the familiar JOIN syntax. For example, the following join
select a.col1, b.col2 from a inner join b on a.col3 = b.col3 May be written as follows:
select a.col1, b.col2 from a inner join b using(col3) That may not look like much of an improvement, but it is a big help in larger joins where many tables have columns with the same names.

        A kind soul has contributed a Debian/Ubuntu package for the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor. Thanks Sebastien Estienne!
Sebastien wrote me that he tested it on Ubuntu Dapper Drake, and I just verified that it works on Edgy Eft.
Since I use Ubuntu on my own machine now, I may integrate this into my build process for future releases of innotop. But for right now, at least there&rsquo;s another installation option.

        I recently attended the MySQL Camp 2006 un-conference at Google&rsquo;s headquarters in Mountain View, California. This article is a high-level overview of the event. If you didn&rsquo;t go, you really missed something good. Go to the next one!
The event The event brought together the MySQL community in a distinctly un-conference setting, to gather in groups to discuss or hack on something, rather than sitting in chairs with donuts and coffee listening to someone show Powerpoint slides branded with corporate logos.

        I recently tested innotop on Microsoft Windows. There was one slight glitch, but I changed a couple lines of code, and now it runs out of the box under ActivePerl. Version 0.1.156 contains those changes for Windows compatibility.
How to install I installed it under ActivePerl 5.8.8 build 819:
 Download and install ActivePerl After installation, open the Perl Package Manager from Start/Programs/ActivePerl 5.8.8 Build 819. Select Time-HiRes, DBD-mysql, and install them.

        I recently got a message letting me know FreeBSD users will soon be able to install the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor through ports. Gentoo GNU/Linux users can find innotop in Portage.
FreeBSD adds innotop to ports When this is finalized, FreeBSD users will be able to install innotop with the following commands:
cd /usr/ports/databases/innotop make all install This is great news. It makes innotop easier to find, install and use.

Innotop upgrade: new features, stability Now you can easily monitor open tables with innotop. Just get the latest version (your configuration file will be upgraded seamlessly) and press the &lsquo;O&rsquo; key (that&rsquo;s capital &ldquo;oh&rdquo;).

        This post originally appeared on O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s blog.
MySQL provides some tools to monitor and troubleshoot a MySQL server, but they don't always suit a MySQL developer or administrator's common needs, or may not work in some scenarios, such as remote or over-the-web monitoring. Fortunately, the MySQL community has created a variety of free tools to fill the gaps. On the other hand, many of these are hard to find via web searches.

        This is the fourth in a series of articles on profiling MySQL. My past three articles have explained how to measure the work a query causes MySQL to do. In this article I introduce a tool I&rsquo;ve written to do the work for you and produce a compact, readable report of that work, with all the math already done, and the measurements labelled and grouped for ease of comprehension. With this tool you can understand query performance at a glance.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Oct 12, 2006</span>
        When people discuss query optimization on MySQL, or say a query doesn&rsquo;t perform well, they usually mention execution time. Execution time is important, but it&rsquo;s not the only metric to use (or even the best). There are many other ways to measure the work a query requires. This article explains how to really profile a query &ndash; what to measure, how to do it as accurately as possible, and what it means.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Oct 9, 2006</span>
        This article shows how to find duplicated rows in a database table. This is a very common beginner question. The basic technique is straightforward. I&rsquo;ll also show some variations, such as how to find &ldquo;duplicates in two columns&rdquo; (a recent question on the #mysql IRC channel).
How to find duplicated rows The first step is to define what exactly makes a row a duplicate of another row. Most of the time this is easy: they have the same value in some column.

        I&rsquo;ve made more improvements to the duplicate index checker. I addressed a MySQL bug Roland Bouman mentioned to me, added more tests to the suite, and made changes so it considers more types of indexes now (HASH, BTREE, SPATIAL). I made no changes to the foreign key checking.
The bug Roland mentioned is a problem with SHOW CREATE TABLE that causes MySQL to show an index as type HASH when it&rsquo;s really a BTREE.

Of course, that means it&rsquo;s harder to find errors because it doesn&rsquo;t complain and let me know they exist, but that&rsquo;s what you are for :-)
I&rsquo;m also making a sort of homepage for it. I just don&rsquo;t have much time to put into these things right now, so a &ldquo;real&rdquo; homepage may be a long time off, I don&rsquo;t know.

        Do you know the fine details of MySQL&rsquo;s transactional error handling with the InnoDB storage engine? If you&rsquo;re writing transactional SQL, you need to be prepared to handle errors appropriately, and to do that, you need to know how MySQL handles them. This article introduces you to the topic.
How InnoDB differs from other engines When a MySQL query has an error in a non-transactional storage engine, such as MyISAM, the results are anybody&rsquo;s guess.

It&rsquo;s an &ldquo;un-conference,&rdquo; which means there is no set schedule, and it&rsquo;s up to us to make out of the event whatever we wish it to be.

        I was poking around in the MySQL source code, namely in sql/sql_yacc.yy, and found a hidden treat: there&rsquo;s a SHOW COLUMN TYPES command. It&rsquo;s fun to read source code!
The command is undocumented, but does work. It returns just two rows, which give information about TINYINT and TINYINT UNSIGNED. And it has been in the source for a long time, certainly since version 4.1.21. There&rsquo;s even a status counter for it in the SHOW STATUS command: Com_show_column_types.

        What was a 5-minute script has become a bigger project. I&rsquo;ve made more improvements to the duplicate index checker. Soon it will require product activation and have security vulnerabilities every week. Seriously: this is the third iteration, and three strikes and you automate, so I automated. I have a test suite now (your contributions welcome), and I addressed two shortcomings readers pointed out in comments on the original article. You now get better foreign key checking, and FULLTEXT indexes are ignored.
