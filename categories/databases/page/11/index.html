        <span class="post-date">Thu, Jun 9, 2011</span>
        MySQL Replication by Russell Dyer, Silent Killdeer, 2010. About 180 pages.
This is a pocket-sized guide to setting up and managing MySQL replication. It is self-published and made via print-on-demand technology. Topics include how replication works, setting up replication, making backups, and administering replication after it&rsquo;s working. There are several appendixes for replication-related functionality in the MySQL server and command-line tools.
This book doesn&rsquo;t go into great depth, so don&rsquo;t expect it to be a reference manual to replication internals or anything like that.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Jun 8, 2011</span>
        PostgreSQL 9 Administration Cookbook. By Simon Riggs and Hannu Krosing, Packt, 2010. Approximately 330 pages.
This is a good book for PostgreSQL database administrators to pick up, especially if you&rsquo;re new to PostgreSQL but familiar with another system such as Oracle, SQL Server, or MySQL. It has more than 80 &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; that range from quick tips to moderately detailed discussion of how to accomplish specific tasks. The chapters and recipes are well organized, and you can either read the book from start to finish or jump to a specific recipe for quick help.

        To follow on to my earlier links to Brendan Gregg&rsquo;s blog posts on measuring I/O latency, there is a third one discussing DTrace, and then a very detailed response from Mark Leith showing how to do it with the PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA in MySQL 5.5.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, May 23, 2011</span>
        This post originally appeared on the Engine Yard blog.
Are your migrations the execute-and-pray variety? If so, you are probably not (yet!) running a large application. Even small applications can benefit from a more careful migration process. It&rsquo;s important to establish the process now, before things get big, because it will be much more difficult later. In my study of emergency issues, the single most valuable preventive measure I identified was change control.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, May 15, 2011</span>
        Brendan Gregg has a very good ongoing series of blog posts about the importance of measuring latency at the layer that&rsquo;s appropriate for the question you are trying to answer. If you&rsquo;re wondering whether I/O latency is a problem for MySQL, you need to measure I/O latency at the filesystem layer, not the disk layer. There are a lot of factors to consider. To quote from his latest post: &gt; This isn’t really a problem with iostat(1M) – it’s a great tool for system administrators to understand the usage of their resources.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, May 15, 2011</span>
        Henrik just wrote a good article on different ways of achieving high availability with MySQL. I was going to respond in the comments, but decided it is better not to post such a long comment there.
One of the questions I think is useful to ask is what kind of high availability is desired. It is quite possible for a group of several people to stand in a hallway and talk about high availability, all of them apparently discussing the same thing but really talking about very different things.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, May 10, 2011</span>
        This month&rsquo;s Maatkit release includes a new tool that&rsquo;s kind of an old tool at the same time. We wrote it a couple years ago for a client who has a very large set of tables and many queries and developers, and wants the database&rsquo;s schema and queries to self-document for data-flow analysis purposes. At the time, it was called mk-table-access and was rather limited &ndash; just a few lines of code wrapped around some existing modules, with an output format that wasn&rsquo;t generic enough to be broadly useful.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, May 10, 2011</span>
        Vadim has taught me that valid benchmarks are both simple and complex. Simple, because the basic principles are few; complex, because the devil is in the details and it&rsquo;s a lot of work to satisfy the basic requirements. I&rsquo;ll give the simple version here.
 Benchmarks must be appropriate. The workload, sample dataset, distribution of work and data, and so on must be relevant and meaningful for the intended purpose. Running the wrong benchmark rarely teaches anything.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, May 4, 2011</span>
        I am not a fan of the MMM tool for managing MySQL replication. This is a topic of vigorous debate among different people, and even within Percona not everyone feels the same way, which is why I&rsquo;m posting it here instead of on an official Percona blog. There is room for legitimate differences of opinion, and my opinion is just my opinion. Nonetheless, I think it&rsquo;s important to share, because a lot of people think of MMM as a high availability tool, and that&rsquo;s not a decision to take lightly.

        I am ridiculously far behind on reading blog posts since the MySQL conference. I like to lag somewhat behind, because then when I read the posts I get to see some comments. But I&rsquo;m much farther behind now than I want to be. This is mostly the fault of the MySQL replication, Performance Schema, NDB Cluster, and InnoDB developers, who just announced a large number of improvements in the upcoming MySQL 5.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 18, 2011</span>
        I split my time last week between the IOUG&rsquo;s Collaborate conference in Orlando, Florida and O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s MySQL Conference &#038; Expo in California. The contrast was stark. For me as a MySQLer, Collaborate was a dud. On the other hand, the MySQL conference O&rsquo;Reilly puts on is superb. It is vital to MySQL as a project and as a community, and it follows that it&rsquo;s vital to MySQL&rsquo;s business success. Oracle needs to participate to make it a success in the future.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Apr 5, 2011</span>
        People keep asking me &ldquo;what is going to happen to MySQL now that Oracle has screwed MySQL?&rdquo; I bluntly disagree that any such thing has happened. This blog post is just my personal view and does not reflect my employer&rsquo;s opinion, but Oracle might have saved MySQL from what I can see. There is no evidence that supports the hysterical doomsday theories. (Witness MySQL 5.5, probably the best MySQL release in history.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Apr 1, 2011</span>
        Working at Percona has taught me to love being disruptive and creating innovative pricing models. In particular, their pay-as-you-go pricing in 15-minute increments, plus the ability to go from first contact to having them logged in and working in a few minutes with just a credit card, has been game-changing. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to take that to the next level and create a new business, offering MySQL services with a radically simple pricing model.

        I see that &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; has become the new buzzword with a spike of hype around it. Everyone&rsquo;s jumping on it. Companies are eager to promote their products as &ldquo;Big Data,&rdquo; just as they were eager to be associated with Web 2.0, Service-Oriented Architectures, and all the rest. Predictably, there&rsquo;s basically zero agreement on what it means.
I&rsquo;ve seen &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; mentioned in the context of 1TB, which I think is rather moderate sized.

The command simply throws a syntax error:
alter table t exchange partition p1 with table t2; The worklog is still open, although a related bug report it mentions is closed and pushed into trunk.

For those who know MySQL, this won&rsquo;t be exciting, but if you&rsquo;re new to it, I hope it will be a good orientation to what you should focus on and ignore.
Sheeri Cabral posted a good round-up of the MySQL talks at Collaborate on the PalominoDB blog.
