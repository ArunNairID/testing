        <span class="post-date">Fri, Apr 11, 2014</span>
        I had a great time at Percona Live. I think this was the best MySQL conference I&rsquo;ve ever been to. (The food was excellent too. The fastest way to a man&rsquo;s heart is through his stomach.)
The talks I attended were very good. Jay Janssen&rsquo;s tutorial on Percona XtraDB Cluster was impressive. I can&rsquo;t imagine how much time he must have spent preparing for that.
I was very happy that Oracle, MariaDB, and WebScaleSQL had a strong presence, too.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Mar 2, 2014</span>
        <p>Time-series databases are of particular interest to me these days. Not only is
<a href="https://vividcortex.com/">VividCortex</a> working with large-scale time-series
data, but it&rsquo;s a growing trend in the technology world in general. What&rsquo;s
perhaps most surprising is the dearth of native time-series databases, either
commercial or opensource.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/03/alice.jpg" alt="No Time to Say Hello" /></p>

<h3 id="the-world-is-time-series">The World is Time-Series</h3>

<p>The data we gather is increasingly timestamped and dealt with in time-series
ways. For the last 10 years, I&rsquo;ve worked with &ldquo;roll-up&rdquo; or &ldquo;summary&rdquo; tables
almost constantly. I built, and saw others build, the same types of solutions
over and over. For example, I probably consulted with over a dozen companies who
do search-engine marketing and advertising. Cost tables are a given, and there&rsquo;s
usually cost-per-ad-per-day and half a dozen other summary tables. In my case I
saw these things in the MySQL context, but you can pick your technology and
someone&rsquo;s trying to do time-series tasks on top of it.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Feb 26, 2014</span>
        <p>Sometimes people&rsquo;s perspective can be so interesting. I mean this with
absolutely no irony. Josh Berkus wrote recently in a post about upcoming <a href="http://www.databasesoup.com/2014/02/why-hstore2jsonb-is-most-important.html">JSON
improvements in PostgreSQL 9.4</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MySQL largely rose on the success of PHP, and it fell as PHP became
marginalized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an aside in the blog post, off-topic. But it&rsquo;s
interesting to discuss because it reveals the completely different things people
see when they look at something. It&rsquo;s like the proverbial story about the blind
men describing an elephant. We have such a variety of perceptions.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/02/kaleidoscope.jpg" alt="Elephant" /></p>

<p>This post, by the way, is not yet another flame war about MySQL versus
PostgreSQL. To the contrary, it is very important for MySQL users and
community members to understand that there are other communities who do not
share the same assumptions, values, and beliefs at all. In my experience, many
arguments about things like MySQL versus PostgreSQL result from people (or
groups of people) holding such differences but being unaware of them, and
therefore misinterpreting words and actions from a group who doesn&rsquo;t share the
same worldview, believing them to be dishonest, irrational, or hostile.</p>

        I mentioned Bloom Filters in my talk today at Strata. Afterwards, someone told me it was the first time he&rsquo;d heard of Bloom Filters, so I thought I&rsquo;d write a little explanation of what they are, what they do, and how they work.
But then I found that Jason Davies already wrote a great article about it. Play with his live demo. I was able to get a false positive through luck in a few keystrokes: add alice, bob, and carol to the filter, then test the filter for candiceaklda.

        Do you store date or time values in MySQL?
Would you like to know how to avoid many possible types of pain, most of which you cannot even begin to imagine until you experience them in really fun ways?
Then this blog post is for you. Here is a complete set of rules for how you can avoid aforementioned pain:
 All date and time columns shall be INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL, and shall store a Unix timestamp in UTC.

        I&rsquo;m excited to be speaking at the Percona Live MySQL Conference again this year. I&rsquo;ll present two sessions: Developing MySQL Applications with Go and Knowing the Unknowable: Per-Query Metrics. The first is a walk-through of everything I&rsquo;ve learned over the last 18 months writing large-scale MySQL-backed applications with Google&rsquo;s Go language. The second is about using statistical techniques to find out things you can&rsquo;t even measure, such as how much CPU a query really causes MySQL to use.

        <p>Not long ago I attended a talk about Datomic, which focused a lot on database
immutability and its benefits. I hope to illustrate why many database designs
are much more complicated than Datomic and its ilk. Although Datomic&rsquo;s design
can be presented as <em>advanced</em>, there&rsquo;s another side to the story, which also
holds true for similar databases such as CouchDB. It&rsquo;s a really difficult
problem space, and clean and elegant solutions without nasty edge cases are
difficult to design and implement.</p>

        I clicked around for a few moments but didn&rsquo;t immediately see a license mentioned for the MariaDB knowledgebase. As far as I know, the MySQL documentation is not licensed in a way that would allow copying or derivative works, but at least some of the MariaDB Knowledge Base seems to be pretty similar to the corresponding MySQL documentation. See for example LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE: MariaDB, MySQL.
Oracle&rsquo;s MySQL documentation has a licensing notice that states:

 Advance notice of things they&rsquo;re thinking about doing (deprecating, changing, adding, etc) Heads-up via private emails about news and upcoming things of interest (new features, upcoming announcements that aren&rsquo;t public yet, etc) Solicitation of opinion on proposals that are being floated internally (do you use this feature, would it hurt you if we removed this option, do you care about this legacy behavior we&rsquo;re thinking about sanitizing) I don&rsquo;t know who or what has made this change happen, but it&rsquo;s really welcome.

        Here&rsquo;s a trip down memory lane. I was just cleaning out some stuff and I found some notes I took from a hilarious MySQL seminar a few years back. I won&rsquo;t say when or where, to protect the guilty.[1]
I found it so absurd that I had to write down what I was witnessing. Enough time has passed that we can probably all laugh about this now. Times and people have changed.

        I&rsquo;ve been talking to some smart people about deployment. First a little background. One of my colleagues was working on a project that ultimately didn&rsquo;t bear fruit. It was a system for continuous delivery, and involved reacting to git push by building and shipping to production. But it felt as if the problem shouldn&rsquo;t be separated from provisioning, and from setting up a development environment, and so these things got folded in, and the effort became a boil-the-ocean project that had to be set aside.

        I have followed the &ldquo;Use the Index, Luke!&rdquo; blog for a while. Today Marcus wrote that (I&rsquo;ll paraphrase) MongoDB disgraces NoSQL the same way that MySQL disgraces SQL. I agree with a lot of this, actually, although I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d put it so strongly. People often like products for good reasons, and to think that legions of developers are stupid or ill-educated is suspect, in my opinion.
But that wasn&rsquo;t what I meant to write about.

        Oracle released a bunch of MySQL stuff they&rsquo;ve been working on since the last huge release, and my blog reader filled up with a few dozen posts I&rsquo;m gonna have to read through so I don&rsquo;t feel ignorant. Dear MySQL Engineering Team, could you take pity on me and release these gradually over the course of a month or so next time? Especially since Google discontinued Reader, and I&rsquo;m using Feedly now, and it has a bug that I can&rsquo;t figure out how to report, which result in articles being marked as read when I scroll, which makes me feel super-paranoid-insecure that I&rsquo;m gonna miss an article that I scrolled over without having read yet.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Sep 13, 2013</span>
        It&rsquo;s common wisdom that large-scale database systems require distributing the data across machines. But what seems to be missing in a lot of discussions is distributing the query processing too. By this I mean the actual computation that&rsquo;s performed on the data.
I just had a conversation with Peter Zaitsev yesterday that helped make concrete some thoughts I&rsquo;ve been having about Cassandra for a while. Because Cassandra doesn&rsquo;t allow you to really do any computation in the data (aggregating, evaluating expressions, and so on), if you&rsquo;re going to use it for truly Big data, you&rsquo;re going to fetch enormous amounts of data across the network.

        Continuing with my wishlist, I&rsquo;ll add windowing functions. They&rsquo;re enormously powerful. They allow you to extend relational logic beyond the strict boundaries of tuples. In MySQL at present, one must use ugly hacks to preserve state from one row to the next, such as user variables &ndash; which are not guaranteed to work if the optimizer changes the query plan.
And yeah, PostgreSQL and SQL Server have windowing functions too, and once you&rsquo;ve used them it&rsquo;s a little hard to go back.

        The pace of MySQL engineering has been pretty brisk for the last few years. I think that most of the credit is due to Oracle, but one should not ignore Percona, Monty Program, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and others. Not only are these organizations (and the individuals I haven&rsquo;t mentioned) innovating a lot, they&rsquo;re providing pressure on Oracle to keep up the improvements, too.
But if you look back over the last few years, MySQL is still functionally a lot like it used to be.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Sep 5, 2013</span>
        I&rsquo;ve been considering using TokuDB for a large dataset, primarily because of its high compression. The data is append-only, never updated, rarely read, and purged after a configurable time.
I use partitions to drop old data a day at a time. It&rsquo;s much more efficient than deleting rows, and it lets me avoid indexing the data on the time dimension. Partitioning serves as a crude form of indexing, as well as helping purge old data.
