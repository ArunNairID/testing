        Dear Lazyweb, quick question: once I&rsquo;ve USE-ed a database in MySQL, how can I un-USE it so I have no default database? Is it even possible?

        <p>This is part knowledge share, part appeal: fellow bloggers, I&rsquo;d comment a lot more on your blogs (and I want to!) if I could. Please, make it easy for me to comment &ndash; don&rsquo;t make me log in (I won&rsquo;t do it) or moderate me. I&rsquo;ve found a solution that works really well for me; maybe it&rsquo;ll help you too.</p>

        I just wrote about how Maatkit has gotten some new features for helping people make sure their replicas have an exact copy of the master&rsquo;s data. This work was largely sponsored by one of Percona&rsquo;s customers, whose name I have permission to mention: Vantage Media.

Thanks Vantage! Your sponsorship helps many people and businesses.

        <p>I&rsquo;ve created a set of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/">Cacti templates for graphing stats about MySQL</a>. While these were based on several other people&rsquo;s work, there are many improvements. One of them in particular I want to bring up, and I&rsquo;ll go so far as to say it ought to be a &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; for graphing. That is, don&rsquo;t mix units on a graph.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://vividcortex.com/">VividCortex</a> is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what
your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers <a href="https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/mysql/">MySQL performance

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Oct 4, 2008</span>
        <p>I have recently added some features to <a href="http://www.maatkit.org/">Maatkit&rsquo;s mk-table-checksum</a> tool that can make it easy to checksum the relevant parts of your data more frequently (i.e. <a href="http://www.drgrammar.org/faqs/#59">continually, but not continuously</a>). This in turn makes it possible for you to find out <em>much</em> sooner if a replica becomes different from its master, and then you can take action before the differences affect more of your data.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Sep 19, 2008</span>
        <p>There&rsquo;s a new release with a lot of goodies &ndash; speed, efficiency, user-friendliness, and new features. In particular some of <a href="http://www.percona.com/">Percona&rsquo;s</a> clients have sponsored features for things they need such as the ability to more frequently verify that replicas are in sync with their masters. If you need features, please ask Percona about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://hackmysql.com/">Daniel Nichter</a> has written most of the code for this release. Having a dedicated developer is really moving the project forward. Thanks Daniel!</p>

<p>If you check the issues list on the project&rsquo;s website you&rsquo;ll see we have some ambitious plans for the project, mostly driven by real-world needs from Percona&rsquo;s clients, many of whom run very large data centers and such. It makes me really happy that Maatkit is solving serious problems for which no other solution exists.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the changelog:</p>

        If you thought the activity around planning OpenSQL Camp 2008 had slacked off, it&rsquo;s only because I&rsquo;m both moving to a new house and traveling for business, so I haven&rsquo;t blogged about it. In reality I&rsquo;m not (and shouldn&rsquo;t be!) the main driving force behind this event, so my lack of blogging doesn&rsquo;t reflect anything about it, really.
That said, I&rsquo;d like to renew the call for really great sessions, especially from people who have built open-source databases.

        Sometimes there are funny communication styles between people who are geographically distributed and working together all the time. Recently one of our team members echoed back to me some answers I gave over a chat session:
 Q: Is it OK for me to buy quad-core servers?
A: The old man walks slow but carries much, whilst the young boy runs without a care.
 Okay, okay maybe I wasn&rsquo;t very clear in my message, and maybe it was just a little bit Confucian.

Key facts:
 It is of, by and for the community (you). At this event, all open-source databases are created equal. We&rsquo;ll learn together and grow together. It&rsquo;s a combination conference and hackathon. It&rsquo;s free. It is Friday night Nov 14, 18:00 through Sun the 16th at 18:00 in Charlottesville, Virginia USA in a very cool location.

One of the objections I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about unit-testing is how it&rsquo;s impossible to test code that talks to a database. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too hard,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s easy to test a module that calculates a square root, but a database? Way too much work!&rdquo;</p>

That is, we write tests for each new feature or to catch regressions on each bug we fix. And &ndash; this is crucial &ndash; we write the tests <em>before</em> we write the code.* The tests should initially fail, which is a validation that the new code actually works and the tests actually verify this. If we don&rsquo;t first write a failing testcase, then our code lacks a very important guarantee: &ldquo;if you break this code, then the test case will tell you so.&rdquo; (A test that doesn&rsquo;t fail when the code fails isn&rsquo;t worth writing.)</p>

Or are there enough differences between the RPM-based distros that I can&rsquo;t do it? Mind you, the finished RPM ought to just have some man pages and Perl scripts, so I don&rsquo;t think it will be platform- or distro-specific. But I am just not an expert on it.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Aug 6, 2008</span>
        This post is SEO bait for people trying to scale MySQL&rsquo;s write capacity by writing to both servers in master-master replication. The short answer: you can&rsquo;t do it. It&rsquo;s impossible.
I keep hearing this line of reasoning: &ldquo;if I make a MySQL replication &lsquo;cluster&rsquo; and move half the writes to machine A and half of them to machine B, I can increase my overall write capacity.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a fallacy. All writes are repeated on both machines: the writes you do on machine A are repeated via replication on machine B, and vice versa.
