        <span class="post-date">Thu, May 22, 2008</span>
        Bruce Momjian says
 ...the volume of patches [to PostgreSQL] has risen dramatically during the past few years.  This is total hearsay &ndash; I don&rsquo;t have hard numbers, haven&rsquo;t verified it myself, etc etc. But consider the source!
What can be responsible for this increase in patches to PostgreSQL?

        I have been using Maatkit in a different way since I joined Percona as a consultant. When I&rsquo;m working on a system now, it&rsquo;s a new, unfamiliar system &ndash; not one where I have already installed my favorite programs. And that means I want to grab my favorite productivity tools fast.
I intentionally wrote the Maatkit tools so they don&rsquo;t need to be &ldquo;installed.&rdquo; You just run them, that&rsquo;s all. But I never made them easy to download.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, May 18, 2008</span>
        There is much discussion of why MySQL is more widely adopted than PostgreSQL. The discussion I&rsquo;ve heard is mostly among the PostgreSQL community members, who believe their favorite database server is better in many ways, and are sometimes puzzled why people would choose an inferior product.
There are also many comparison charts that show one server is better than the other in some ways. These don&rsquo;t really seem to help people with this question, either!

        <span class="post-date">Wed, May 14, 2008</span>
        The title of MySQL&rsquo;s website states that they are the world&rsquo;s most popular open-source database. This is false; MySQL is not an open-source database. That assertion is a fact, not an opinion.
MySQL is Free Software, licensed under the GNU GPL. People frequently use the two phrases &ldquo;Free Software&rdquo; and &ldquo;Open Source Software&rdquo; as synonyms, but there are very large, very important differences.
The difference between Free and Open Source Open Source is much more of a development methodology than a philosophical standpoint.

        **Update: ** Karanbir says &ldquo;Just one thing to keep in mind is that we dont want too many people using it from the Testing repository &#8211; we only need enough feedback to move it from testing to stable ( and to be honest, there are already 8 people who have said yes it works &#8211; so move to stable should happen within the next 24 &#8211; 48 hrs ). Once the package is in stable, users on CentOS4 and 5 wont need to do anything more than just &lsquo;yum install maatkit&rsquo; and it will install for them.

        I just got the rest of the production schedule from the publisher, plus the PDF files for quality control, for our upcoming book. (Now I have to proofreeed the whole book!) This is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen the entire production schedule. The book is supposed to go to the printer in the first week of June. I don&rsquo;t know what the on-the-shelf date will be, but I think very shortly after that.

        Zack Urlocker says MySQL 5.1 has zero bugs. He may have been misquoted, or quoted out of context, but there it is. I&rsquo;ll quote enough of it that you can&rsquo;t take it out of context twice:
 Mickos also said MySQL 5.1 has upgraded its reliability and ease of use over 2005&#8242;s v5.0.  "Now we can admit it, but this version is much improved over 5.0, which we weren't totally happy with,"

But you don&rsquo;t have to wait idly. No, not at all! You can pre-order it and then you&rsquo;ll get it as soon as possible. Plus your pre-order will help them figure out how much demand there is, so it doesn&rsquo;t sell out and make you wait for your own copy.

        As promised, I&rsquo;ve created some improved software for monitoring MySQL via Cacti. I began using the de facto MySQL Cacti templates a while ago, but found some things I needed to improve about them. As time passed, I rewrote everything from scratch. The resulting templates are much improved.
 VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti.

        The conference that many of us just went to is called the MySQL Conference and Expo, but a lot of people don&rsquo;t call it that. They call it by the name it had in 2006 and earlier: MySQL User&rsquo;s Conference. In fact, some people say (or blog) that they dislike the new name and they&rsquo;re going to call it the old name, because [&hellip; insert reason here&hellip;].
I call it by the new name that some people dislike so much.

        Here&rsquo;s a rundown of Thursday (day 3) of the MySQL Conference and Expo. This day&rsquo;s sessions were much more interesting to me than Wednesday&rsquo;s, and in fact I wanted to go to several of them in a single time slot a couple of times.
Inside the PBXT Storage Engine This session was, as it sounds, a look at the internals of PBXT, a transactional storage engine for MySQL that has some interesting design techniques.

        Day two of the conference was a little disappointing, as far as sessions went. There were several time blocks where I simply wasn&rsquo;t interested in any of the sessions. Instead, I went to the expo hall and tried to pry straight answers out of sly salespeople. Here&rsquo;s what I attended.
Paying It Forward: Harnessing the MySQL Contributory Resources This was a talk focused on how MySQL has made it possible for community members to contribute to MySQL.

        If you&rsquo;re at the MySQL Conference and Expo, you can get a free sample chapter of the upcoming High Performance MySQL Second Edition. Just go to the exhibition area. As you go through the doors, take an immediate left and look for the sample chapter on O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s table. It&rsquo;s a rough draft and contains typos and my incredibly crude drawings instead of those that will go into the final book, but it should serve to give you an idea of the book&rsquo;s depth and scope.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Apr 16, 2008</span>
        Today is the first day at the conference (aside from the tutorials, which were yesterday). Here&rsquo;s what I went to:
New Subquery Optimizations in 6.0 By Sergey Petrunia. This was a similar session to one I went to last year. MySQL has a few cases where subqueries are badly optimized, and this session went into the details of how this is being addressed in MySQL 6.0. There are several new optimization techniques for all types of subqueries, such as inside-out subqueries, materialization, and converting to joins.

        There are quite a few business angles you might see only if you&rsquo;re here at the conference, and you won&rsquo;t get from blogs. For example, let&rsquo;s take a look at the contents of the shoulder bags they hand out with your registration. (This is only a partial list.)
 SnapLogic&rsquo;s flyer gets it right: their system is compatible with &ldquo;GNU Linux.&rdquo; Hooray, a commercial company acknowledging the GNU operating system for what it is!

        MySQL just gave me an award at this morning&rsquo;s keynote, along with Sheeri Kritzer Cabral (for the second year in a row!) and Diego Medina, for my code contributions to the MySQL community, specifically Maatkit, which makes it easier to make MySQL reliable, fast, and robust. It&rsquo;s an honor to be recognized. And while I could leave it at that, I&rsquo;d like to say a word or two more.
The economy, community, and ecosystem that&rsquo;s building around Free Software can often be very rewarding financially.

        I spent the day Thursday with some of Kickfire&rsquo;s engineers at their headquarters. In this article, I&rsquo;d like to go over a little of the system&rsquo;s architecture and some other details.
Everything in quotation marks in this article is a quote. (I don&rsquo;t use quotes when I&rsquo;m glossing over a technical point &ndash; at least, not in this article.)
Even though I saw one of Kickfire&rsquo;s engineers running queries on the system, they didn&rsquo;t let me actually take the keyboard and type into it myself.

Harrison Fisk (co-author of MySQL Clustering) got the first one, because he told me that he recommends Maatkit to MySQL Support customers about twice a week. I made sure to save one for Jay Pipes too, because his luggage got lost so he has nothing to wear.
