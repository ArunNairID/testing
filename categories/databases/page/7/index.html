        <span class="post-date">Tue, May 1, 2012</span>
        Please join me tomorrow (Wednesday) for a webinar about the new version of pt-online-schema-change, Percona Toolkit&rsquo;s tool for performing nonblocking ALTER TABLE operations. Registration is free. I will explain how the tool works and cover some typical use scenarios. This might be helpful if you&rsquo;re trying to decide whether the tool is right for you. I am also planning to leave plenty of time for questions!

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Apr 26, 2012</span>
        In the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve been caught off guard by the number of people who&rsquo;ve told me they have been evaluating Percona XtraDB Cluster (link), and even more surprised at the projects they&rsquo;re considering it for. Yesterday alone I spoke to several people who have been evaluating it for large, mission-critical enterprise deployments. Some new, some to replace existing systems that use standard MySQL replication. What was interesting is that some people said they&rsquo;ve been putting it through its paces for months &ndash; before we even released it as GA.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Apr 24, 2012</span>
        I don&rsquo;t think there is a single good-quality MySQL init script for a Unix-like operating system. On Windows, there is the service facility, and I used to write Windows services. Based on that, I believe Windows has a pretty good claim to better reliability for start/stop services with MySQL.
What&rsquo;s wrong with the init scripts? Well, let me count the reasons! Wait, I&rsquo;m out of fingers and toes.
I&rsquo;ll just mention the two annoying ones that I&rsquo;ve run into most recently.

        What are your pet peeves about the tools? I have a lot. For example, pt-table-sync doesn&rsquo;t let me do things I want it to do sometimes (and I know it could be made to do them). Another example: pt-query-digest&rsquo;s tcpdump parser doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to TCP sequence numbers, so sometimes it invents a really long-running query where there isn&rsquo;t one. Post your gripes, big and small, in the comments!
(This blog post is an attempt to do a 37signals approach to prioritizing: the stuff people complain about repeatedly is what you should focus on.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Apr 10, 2012</span>
        Oracle has released another huge batch of improvements to MySQL slated for MySQL 5.6. The pace of innovation in MySQL is accelerating rapidly and the improvements are impressive. I have not read all of the blog posts thoroughly yet, but I&rsquo;ve skimmed and it looks fantastic.
The link posted above is ONE of the sets of improvements: there are also a bunch of other posts about new improvements to the query optimizer, InnoDB, and probably more.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 9, 2012</span>
        MySQL became wildly successful in part because it had built-in, simple replication. Sure, it had lots of interesting failure scenarios and was not great at first &mdash; it is much better these days &mdash; but it was nevertheless successful because there was a single, out-of-the-box, not-very-complex way to do replication. I have opined many times before that this was one of the killer features missing from PostgreSQL. I think that can large explain why MySQL became more popular more quickly.

        In case you live under a rock, the MySQL conference starts on Tuesday. There are 8 concurrent tracks of content. Aside from my own talks, here are the sessions I would most like to see.
On Tuesday:
 Tutorial: Innodb and XtraDB Architecture and Performance Optimization. Peter&rsquo;s talks are always great, and this is a perennial favorite. If you have never been, you should go to this one. You will realize how little you really know about InnoDB/XtraDB, and how much it matters.

        Note: This post was an April Fool&rsquo;s Joke. I was not actually working on a 4th edition. As of 2016, there&rsquo;s no project to create a 4th edition yet.
With the 3rd edition of High Performance MySQL finally complete, I&rsquo;ve begun work on the 4th edition. As you know, technology moves much faster than printing presses, and a book is outdated very quickly, so this is a never-ending project. I&rsquo;m also outlining the 5th edition in anticipation of starting it immediately afterwards.

        O&rsquo;Reilly authors get 10 copies of their own books for free, and my copies of the third edition of High Performance MySQL arrived yesterday. Now it&rsquo;s official! It feels nice to actually hold it in my hand.
A few people have asked me about messages from Amazon saying that their ship date has changed. I don&rsquo;t know anything about that; maybe Amazon just made a wild guess the first time and now they actually know something more realistic.

 Note: VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production. VividCortex offers MySQL performance monitoring and PostgreSQL performance management among many other features.

        If you follow what Percona is up to, you might have noticed that I&rsquo;ve created a set of high-quality monitoring and graphing plugins for MySQL and related systems. Currently they support Nagios and Cacti. I&rsquo;ll give a free webinar on March 28th discussing these, and more broadly, discussing how to monitor MySQL successfully to avoid common problems like spammy alerts about nonexistent problems.

        My earlier blog post was wrong, our block of rooms for the conference is still available past the 12th of March. However, there are apparently zero rooms available in the Hyatt other than our reserved block, and our block discount will expire soon (I&rsquo;m a little hazy on the exact details, because I thought it was the 12th). What I have been told in no uncertain terms is this: &ldquo;If you know anyone who plans to attend the conference and needs a hotel room, they should book IMMEDIATELY in our room block or they will not be able to get a room in the Hyatt either at a reasonable rate or at all.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Mar 13, 2012</span>
        Do you know why relational databases are called relational? I commonly see explanations such as this:
 an RDBMS is called a relational database system because the data is stored in tables.
 There, now that&rsquo;s all cleared up! Or not.
The most common explanation or reason I hear cited for the name is that it&rsquo;s because of relationships between data. But this isn&rsquo;t really accurate.
The real reason is because of something called relational algebra, which takes its name from a mathematical construct called a relation.

Submit a BoF Session &bull; Submit a Lightning Talk
Why is this a big deal? Why the hard deadline? It turns out that this is one of the things I always underestimated. Planning for these is actually quite difficult and they are very expensive.
