        I&rsquo;ll be joining Percona for a free day of MySQL education and insight at their upcoming Percona University Washington DC event on September 12th. My topic is accessing MySQL from Google&rsquo;s Go programming language. I&rsquo;ve learned a lot about this over the past year or so, and hopefully I can help you get a quick-start.
If you&rsquo;re not familiar with Go, it&rsquo;s the darling of the Hacker News crowd these days.

        This is hypothetical.
What would happen if I did the following?
alter table mysql.user add unique key(User);  I&rsquo;m tossing this out there for people to think about because I&rsquo;ve always thought that MySQL&rsquo;s authentication model is a nuisance:
 MySQL considers both your host name and user name in identifying you because there is no reason to assume that a given user name belongs to the same person on all hosts.

        I&rsquo;ve posted slides for my Velocity talk on VividCortex&rsquo;s blog. The talk explained how we use exponentially weighted moving statistics to generate a meta-metric of abnormality for the time-series metrics measured from MySQL. That&rsquo;s kind of a mouthful. Maybe you had to be there :-)

        Are you a Django user? There&rsquo;s an upcoming Django conference in Chicago in a few months, and I know they&rsquo;re looking for speakers with MySQL experience in particular. One suggestion the organizers have floated is a talk on MySQL:
 I&rsquo;m looking for someone to give at least one MySQL talk there. In particular, I would love a (friendly but vigorous) &ldquo;Why you should use MySQL instead of PostgreSQL talk&rdquo;, as PostgreSQL tends to get a lot of love and attention at Django events, and MySQL not so much.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, May 24, 2013</span>
        This 35-minute video from the recent Google I/O conference explains how to use Go&rsquo;s concurrency primitives &ndash; goroutines, channels, and the select statement &ndash; to do things elegantly, correctly, and safely in a few lines of Go, which would otherwise turn your brain into a pretzel in most programming languages.
My favorite thing about Go is that a good Go program looks self-evident and obvious, even when it may be doing things that would be insanely complex in another language.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 29, 2013</span>
        Last week Tokutek announced that they&rsquo;re open-sourcing their TokuDB storage engine for MySQL. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with TokuDB, it&rsquo;s an ACID-compliant storage engine with a high-performance index technology known as fractal tree indexing. Fractal trees have a number of nice characteristics, but perhaps the most interesting is that they deliver consistently high performance under varying conditions, such as when data grows much larger than memory or is updated frequently. B-tree indexes tend to get fragmented over time, and exhibit a performance cliff when data doesn&rsquo;t fit in memory anymore.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Apr 25, 2013</span>
        Years ago I complained bitterly about MySQL&rsquo;s backwards development and release model, which made guinea pigs out of the paying customers. I think I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s been fixed for years. And it&rsquo;s really fixed right in my opinion &ndash; much better than what I proposed.
Congratulations, and thanks, to the MySQL team for superhuman software engineering, release engineering, documentation, bug triage and analysis, and doing a million things right &ndash; in other words, making a damn good database, which is hard.

        We&rsquo;re ironing out a kink that&rsquo;s preventing Planet MySQL from aggregating VividCortex&rsquo;s blog feed, so while that&rsquo;s in progress, I&rsquo;ll post a quick note on what we&rsquo;re up to at VividCortex, for the Planet MySQL readers.
VividCortex is a monitoring and analysis product for MySQL, provided as Software-As-A-Service, with agents that run in your systems and report back to our APIs. The agents are super-efficient and non-obtrusive (you&rsquo;ve probably noticed my posts about Go recently).

        I&rsquo;m really looking forward to Percona Live this year. I will be there, along with Kyle Redinger, my co-founder at VividCortex. I feel that this year the conference has come full circle. 2007 was my first year at the conference, and it was amazing. This year is tremendously exciting for me because it feels like we&rsquo;re back on the 2007 trajectory.
Those were the golden days. Things were a little sad in 2010 and 2011 as the MySQL community tried to figure out the new landscape and O&rsquo;Reilly decided to stop running the event, but then in 2012 we all said &ldquo;we&rsquo;re back!

        High Performance MySQL, 3rd Edition has been selling very well. It&rsquo;s translated into many languages. O&rsquo;Reilly sends me a hard-copy of the translations, and I have a whole section on my bookshelf dedicated to them. It&rsquo;s really satisfying to look at it.
Today I&rsquo;m happy to announce that we&rsquo;re moving forward with a new batch of translations. Demand has been so strong that we want to make the book accessible to as wide an audience as possible.

        Last night at the Golang-DC meetup I spoke about building (MySQL) database applications with Go. The meetup was well attended and people were very enthusiastic about Go. I spent a few minutes talking about Go in general, how VividCortex uses Go (we&rsquo;ve built our agents, API servers, and all backend processes with Go), why we like it, some of the nice things it enables like making it easy to build very resilient programs, and then I gave the presentation, which I&rsquo;ve embedded below.

        I really don&rsquo;t like running my database in &ldquo;I Love Garbage&rdquo; mode, so I set the following SQL_MODE:
 STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO, NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO, NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,NO_ZERO_DATE, NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY
 Guess what WordPress does with that? It doesn&rsquo;t install. If you set the SQL_MODE to empty and install WordPress, then restore the SQL_MODE, WordPress will run, but if you try to create a post you&rsquo;ll see an error page that says &ldquo;You are not allowed to edit this post.

        I am currently finishing some features to make a program highly resilient to occasional crashing bugs. A particular function was found to crash on queries of the form WHERE x IN(NULL), and that crashed the entire program. Now we have a framework for intelligently recovering from arbitrary crashes. I will write more on this in the future, because I think it&rsquo;s a very interesting thing to share.
In this episode, I want to focus on a related topic: how do you test a program that is supposed to be resilient to bugs you can&rsquo;t predict?

        I was a guest on the Food Fight Show last week, along with a bevy of really smart people asking and answering tough questions on fault detection. We didn&rsquo;t talk a lot about MySQL, but given that VividCortex is focusing on MySQL initially, pretty much all of my experience with zero-threshold, zero-configuration fault detection is MySQL-based.
It&rsquo;s a fun conversation with a lot of insights into the industry, what&rsquo;s wrong with current monitoring tools, and where monitoring is going.

I have traveled a lot, written books, done a bunch of consulting, and spoken widely on MySQL, other databases, open source, and so forth.

I am sure I am missing a lot of events, but some of these are only publicized in specific channels, and I wanted to mention them here to help spread the word.

        Most of the time, when people say &ldquo;scalability&rdquo; they mean any of dozens of things. Most of the time, when I say it I mean exactly one precisely defined thing. However, I don&rsquo;t claim that&rsquo;s the only correct use of &ldquo;scalability.&rdquo; There is another, in particular, that I think is very important to understand: the inherent limitations of the system. This second one doesn&rsquo;t have a single mathematical definition, but it&rsquo;s vital nonetheless.

        I&rsquo;m really looking forward to this year&rsquo;s Percona Live MySQL Conference. This is always THE event of the year for me in the MySQL conference circuit. It&rsquo;s also the first year I haven&rsquo;t been a speaker! I&rsquo;ve been a speaker since 2007 but this year things were too uncertain for me to submit a proposal in time.
As usual, the real highlight of the conference is seeing and talking to everyone.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Feb 3, 2013</span>
        I wonder if the MySQL archaeologists out there would be willing to unearth some (presumably ancient) history for me. Why does the logging configuration merit special mention in the version_comment variable?
The more I think about this, the more bizarre it seems. I enabled logging. The version reported by the server changed. No, really, is my server somehow a different version of MySQL now?
