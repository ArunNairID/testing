        Some unsettling things happened in MySQL in the past week or so.
New storage engine not mentioned in the changelog There&rsquo;s a bit of a storm brewing over at the MySQL Performance Blog, where Vadim reports discovering a new storage engine added without mention in the 5.1.33 changelog. This is in defiance of the policy of not making changes in a production release. And it certainly belongs in the changelog &ndash; but there is no sign that anyone will remedy this problem.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Apr 8, 2009</span>
        I want to show you two very expensive SQL idioms that almost everyone uses. These are not query optimization problems &ndash; they are financially expensive patterns of SQL.
These queries don&rsquo;t do what the user thinks they do, and thus they create subtle bugs. And the bugs cause a lot of trouble, and they&rsquo;re hard to track down, and much time is spent on them. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write about this for a while, but a book I read recently brought this topic up again, so I dug this draft out and finished it.

        As I said yesterday, I was only able to attend a couple of talks at the PostgreSQL Conference East 2009 this morning before leaving to catch my flight back to Virginia.
 Effects of Flash and SSDs on PostgreSQL &ndash; by Jignesh Shah of Sun Microsystems. Jignesh went through a series of comparisons between hard drives and SSD drives, looking at where they really make sense in terms of performance, capacity and price.

        I missed Friday and part of Saturday, but I was at PostgreSQL Conference East 2009 for part of Saturday (and will be for part of Sunday too.) A brief recap of the talks I attended:
 PostgreSQL Backup and Recovery &ndash; by Kevin Kempter of Consistent State. I arrived halfway through, and heard about PITR, Slony, and a few other topics. Playing with Playr &ndash; by Jonah Harris of myYearbook. Playr is a tool that analyzes log files, and lets you replay them exactly (same timing, same commit order, same concurrency, etc).

        WARNING: nearly every word of this post is intentionally false. This is an April Fool's joke. There is so much misinformation out there about how MySQL works. If you&rsquo;ve talked to someone from PostgreSQL, you&rsquo;ve surely heard some of it: &ldquo;MySQL doesn&rsquo;t even have transactions,&rdquo; for example. And this from a PostgreSQL user, who uses a database that doesn&rsquo;t even run on Windows.
But even within the ranks of people who supposedly know MySQL&rsquo;s workings, lots of people just get things dead wrong.

        Maatkit version 3329 has been released, as per our usual monthly release cycle.
Significant changes in this version include some bug fixes to mk-duplicate-key-checker, and a lot of new features in mk-query-digest. We made some changes to mk-table-checksum and mk-table-sync. We also updated shared code in all tools.
Interesting and significant things to mention this month:

        Here&rsquo;s a quick productivity tip: when optimizing queries by rewriting them to different forms that should return the same results, you can verify that you get the same results by taking a checksum of them.
Just set your pager to md5sum:
mysql&gt; pager md5sum - PAGER set to 'md5sum -' mysql&gt; select * from test; a09bc56ac9aa0cbcc659c3d566c2c7e4 - 4096 rows in set (0.00 sec)

I think Josh Berkus has talked me into doing some kind of lightning talk on what the PostgreSQL community is doing right from my POV, and what parts of that I try to emulate in &ldquo;other&rdquo; areas of my professional life (if you know what I mean), though I can&rsquo;t see how that can actually fit into a lightning talk.

        What&rsquo;s going on at your favorite open-source database developer mailing list? Non-scientific memory of what I&rsquo;ve been seeing lately:
 The Drizzle list is talking about test coverage and completeness, and schedulers. The MySQL internals list has recently been dominated with talk about coding standards. The PostgreSQL hackers list is talking about a ton of stuff. I don&rsquo;t even try to keep up. The Percona launchpad list is talking about bugs, xtrabackup, and more bugs and patches for them.

        Suppose you have a MySQL master-slave replication setup. It is very straightforward, nothing exotic at all. Imagine that it is the simplest possible setup. Everything is fine, there is nothing wrong or misconfigured with either server.
Now you add another replica, and replication on your existing replica fails. You did not change anything on your existing replica or master. How did this happen?

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Mar 13, 2009</span>
        A while back I was at a seminar on migrating database applications to MySQL. A lot of the attendees were Oracle users. Based on their questions, comments and conversations during lunch, I made the following list of things Oracle users need to know about migrating to MySQL. Most of these are &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo; that would be contraindications or require some thought about a workaround.
Note: this is not meant to be MySQL-bashing.

        I think it&rsquo;s occasionally interesting to look back at what people wrote about things while they were happening, especially after big changes (founder and CEO leaving, for example). Here&rsquo;s a blog post from May of 2008, by Henrik Ingo and Ignacio Torres, about MySQL&rsquo;s business model. No commentary &ndash; just the link.

        If you&rsquo;ve been holding out for that golden opportunity, now&rsquo;s a great time to get involved in Maatkit.
Until now I haven&rsquo;t really made a conscious effort to open-source the decision process and get people involved; Maatkit has been largely driven by so-called &ldquo;real-world needs,&rdquo; as perceived through my little lens on the world (and emails from the whole Percona team telling me when something&rsquo;s wrong). I guess I am likely to remain some kind of benevolent dictator, because I created Maatkit and historically I&rsquo;m the main hacker.

        After I wrote about things you need to know about MySQL backups, a customer contacted me and asked me what I know about SecoBackup for MySQL. I see it has a very low cost and Percona has Amazon accounts for testing purposes, so I quickly downloaded s3sql_2.2.0.1-2.01_i386.deb, installed it, configured it, and gave it a whirl.
Since I just want to see what it does to take a backup, I started up a sandbox running from /tmp/12345 and configured it to backup msandbox:msandbox@127.

        I&rsquo;m not sure this has been publicized much in the PostgreSQL world yet, but the Percona Performance Conference is not a MySQL-centric event. We&rsquo;re hoping for good sessions on PostgreSQL and lots of other topics. So this is an invitation &ndash; come attend, and submit sessions.
A few words about marketing. The event is free, and even though it&rsquo;s stamped with Percona&rsquo;s name and under Percona&rsquo;s control, it is a technical event.

        I&rsquo;ve just finished reading Scalable Internet Architectures by Theo Schlossnagle. It&rsquo;s a great book. Anyone building large systems should read it. Heck, anyone building any system that needs to run on more than one server should read it.
The book got mixed reviews on Amazon, but I really think that&rsquo;s about writing style, not substance. Sometimes Theo takes the reader on a scenic tour of something that doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much to do with the subject matter, and then wraps up by showing how it is actually directly relevant.

        I just returned from a MySQL Federal Migration Boot Camp, jointly presented by Carahsoft and Sun/MySQL. It was a half-day seminar on the topic of migrating applications to MySQL, targeted to the US Government sector. Specifically, most of the audience seemed to be running Oracle, though there were some users of other systems (Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, Informix, etc).
Ronald Bradford presented the whole thing. I thought he did a great job giving a fair and balanced look at topics such as what types of applications are good candidates for migration, what gotchas you might encounter, etc.
