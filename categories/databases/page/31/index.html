        <span class="post-date">Fri, Oct 5, 2007</span>
        MySQL Toolkit version numbers are based on Subversion revision number. This release is the first past the 1,000-commit milestone. It also marks several days of being in Sourceforge&rsquo;s top 100 most active projects. It has been in the top 300 for a couple of months, and the top 1000 for, um, a long time. While I would hasten to say I&rsquo;m not a popularity-contest-focused person, it&rsquo;s rewarding to see that people think this project is important and useful.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 3, 2007</span>
        I wanted to point out something that might not be obvious from the name: MySQL Parallel Dump can be used as a generic wrapper to discover tables and databases, and fork off worker processes to do something to them in parallel. That &ldquo;something&rdquo; can easily be invoking mysqlcheck &ndash; or any other program. This makes it really easy for you to do multi-threaded whatever-you-need-to-do on MySQL tables. Here&rsquo;s how:
mysql-parallel-dump [options] -- 'mysqlcheck --optimize %D %N' There are several things going on here:

        This release of MySQL Toolkit fixes some minor bugs, and adds major new functionality to MySQL Parallel Dump.
Big News: MySQL Parallel Dump I wrote a lot more tests and cleaned up MySQL Parallel Dump a lot (fixed bugs with failed dumps not being reported, for instance) but the really big news is I added chunking functionality to it. Now you can say
mysql-parallel-dump --chunksize 100000 and it will try to divide each table into chunks with 100,000 rows each.

        I wrote a couple weeks ago about my work on the Backup and Recovery chapter for High Performance MySQL, 2nd Edition. Thanks for your comments and suggestions, and thanks to those of you who helped me over email as well.
I&rsquo;ve had several questions about what is included in the chapter, so I thought I&rsquo;d post the outline as it stands now:

        This release of MySQL Toolkit adds a new tool, fixes some minor bugs, and adds new functionality to one of the helper scripts.
New tool: MySQL Parallel Dump I wrote an introduction to MySQL Parallel Dump yesterday. It&rsquo;s a much smarter way to dump your data if you have a lot of it, and it&rsquo;s actually a very usable lightweight multi-threaded backup tool (it can do most dump-oriented backup jobs without a wrapper script, in my opinion).

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Sep 30, 2007</span>
        Kevin Burton wrote recently about why SHOW SLAVE STATUS is really not a good way to monitor how far behind your replica servers are, and how replica network timeouts can mess up the replica lag. I&rsquo;d like to chime in and say this is exactly why I thought Jeremy Cole&rsquo;s MySQL Heartbeat script was such a natural fit for the MySQL Toolkit. It measures replica lag in a &ldquo;show me the money&rdquo; way: it looks for the effects of up-to-date replication, rather than asking the replica how far behind it thinks it is.

        A while ago Peter Zaitsev wrote about his wishes for mysqldump. These included multi-threaded dumps and &ldquo;safe&rdquo; dumps that would wait for a server to restart if it crashed, then keep dumping other tables. I&rsquo;ve had sketches of this done for a while, but during this week I fleshed it out while writing about backup and recovery for our upcoming book. I had my own list of features I wanted to add:

        This release of MySQL Toolkit adds a new tool, fixes some minor bugs, and adds new functionality to several of the tools.
New tool: MySQL Heartbeat This tool was contributed by Proven Scaling&rsquo;s Jeremy Cole and Six Apart. It measures replication delay on a replica, which can be daisy-chained to any depth. It does not rely on SHOW SLAVE STATUS, and in fact it doesn&rsquo;t even need the replica processes to be running.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Sep 19, 2007</span>
        Progress on High Performance MySQL, Second Edition is coming along nicely. You have probably noticed the lack of epic multi-part articles on this blog lately &ndash; that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m spending most of my spare time on the book. At this point, we have significant work done on some of the hardest chapters, like Schema Optimization and Query Optimization. I&rsquo;ve been deep in the guts of those hard optimization chapters for a while now, so I decided to venture into lighter territory: Backup and Recovery, which is one of the few chapters we planned to &ldquo;revise and expand&rdquo; from the first edition, rather than completely writing from scratch.

        This article shows you how to use a little-known InnoDB feature to find out what is holding the lock for which an InnoDB transaction is waiting. I then show you how to use an undocumented feature to make this even easier with innotop.
Background One of the most common complaints I&rsquo;ve heard from DBAs used to other database servers is &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find out who holds the locks that are blocking all these connections and making them time out.

        This release is part of the unstable 1.5 branch. Its features will ultimately go into the stable 1.6 branch. You can download it from the innotop-devel package.
 Note: VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production. VividCortex offers MySQL performance monitoring and PostgreSQL performance management among many other features.
 The major change is I&rsquo;ve ripped out the W (Lock Waits) mode and enabled innotop to discover not only what a transaction is waiting for, but what it holds too.

I&rsquo;m finding a lot of the work in writing a book comes from some of the same things that make software hard: coordinating work, deciding what should go where, and so on.

        This release of MySQL Toolkit fixes some minor bugs and adds new functionality to four of the tools. Some of the changes I made were in response to feedback I got at the recent MySQL Camp. I&rsquo;m still working on some of the feature requests, such as daemon-izing certain tools.
For those who requested features for MySQL Query Profiler, the tab-separated format should give you the desired output: no zero rows, and variables are not renamed.

Neither of the first edition&rsquo;s authors (Jeremy Zawodny and Derek Balling) is working on this project, but they&rsquo;re with us in spirit, I think.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Aug 29, 2007</span>
        A high-performance application that has producers and consumers of some resource, such as a queue of messages, needs an efficient way to notify the consumers when the producer has inserted into the queue. Polling the queue for changes is not a good option. MySQL&rsquo;s GET_LOCK() and RELEASE_LOCK() functions can provide both mutual exclusivity and notifications.
This post was prompted by a message to the MySQL general emailing list some time ago, but I&rsquo;m finally getting around to actually testing the theoretical solution I mentioned then (I can never just think my way through anything that involves locking and waiting&hellip; I have to test it).

        I caught most of the second day of MySQL Camp 2007. It was fun and educational as before. The format was a little different than the last Camp; everything was in one room. Google and Proven Scaling provided food. Sessions were loosely organized, to say the least, but that&rsquo;s what an un-conference is all about. When I got there, Ronald Bradford was presenting on MySQL Proxy. Bob Stein, creator of Visibone charts and cheat-sheets, followed with a session seeking feedback to improve the charts.

        I&rsquo;ve just released changes to all tools in MySQL Toolkit. The biggest changes are in MySQL Table Sync, which I&rsquo;m beginning to give sane defaults and options to. Some of the changes are incompatible (but that&rsquo;s what you get with MySQL Table Sync, which is still very rough). I also found and fixed some bugs with MySQL Visual Explain. Thanks to everyone who submitted bug reports.
Note, the formatting overflow in MySQL Query Profiler was not a security vulnerability.
