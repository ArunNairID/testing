        <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 29, 2008</span>
        This release of Maatkit is basically all about mk-log-parser, our new log analysis tool. Daniel and I have been working hard on it all month, adding killer new features like &#8211;review, fixing tons of bugs, and making it twice as fast. I believe it&rsquo;s far and away the best slow-log analysis tool in existence, both in terms of functionality and quality. (Do any of the other tools even have test suites&hellip;?

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Dec 23, 2008</span>
        I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the business of what&rsquo;s variously come to be called commercial open-source and enterprise open-source. I&rsquo;m interested in the gestalt &ndash; the product, development processes, marketing, licensing and so on.
MySQL has tried many different ways to earn money. These include dual licensing, support subscriptions, a knowledgebase, consulting, an Enterprise/Community split, trying to make parts of the server closed-source, making tools in a split community/premium version, building functionality externally in closed-source software where they can charge for it, and most recently creating three tiers of functionality for the MySQL 5.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Dec 20, 2008</span>
        Today I recommended that a customer begin using MySQL 5.1 for development of their new product. There is virtually no risk of doing this, and in fact, the risk of not doing so is quite material. Upgrading the database later would be silly when you could start using it now and find out how best to work with it. Notice that the single criterion I&rsquo;m mentioning is risk, not features.

        I tried to post a comment to Kenny Gorman&rsquo;s post on Tuning for very large shared_buffers article, but it seems to have gone into the spam bucket. I was torn about whether it&rsquo;s worth a separate post anyway, so this tipped me over the edge.
My question is what happens in the other 3 scenarios that weren&rsquo;t measured? Namely,
 Test#4: buffered I/O and 20GB of shared_buffers Test#5: direct I/O and 500MB of shared_buffers Test#6: direct I/O and 2GB of shared_buffers  Without these, I&rsquo;m unable to form an opinion on the article&rsquo;s conclusions:

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 11, 2008</span>
        With all the furor over MySQL 5.1 GA, its release schedule, its quality, etc etc I think a fundamental claim is being left un-examined. Lots of people are saying that if you leave out the new features in 5.1 and look only at the features that existed in 5.0, it&rsquo;s better quality.
The implication is that the process of building 5.1 looked like this: rip out nasty code and fix it all up, so there&rsquo;s a brand new architecture free of code debt.

        The December release is here! There are some goodies in this release, but the major one is an initial version of mk-log-parser, a slow log analysis tool that is carefully designed (with lots of input from Percona consultants) to make slow log analysis as productive and easy as possible. It&rsquo;s based on a lot of work Daniel and I have done on log analysis over the years (I actually wrote the initial version a long time ago but never released it).

        If you were to measure MySQL&rsquo;s &ldquo;loadavg,&rdquo; how would you do it?
The following metric (in pseudocode) is borrowed from Trevor Price at Aggregate Knowledge. It&rsquo;s a way to calculate average query response time. What do you think of it?
$start = microtime(); $status1 = SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE Questions; for ( 1 .. 100 ) { $num_running += SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SHOW PROCESSLIST WHERE Command = Query; } $time = microtime() - $start; return 0 unless $time; $status2 = SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE Questions; $qps = ($status2 - $status1) / $time; return 0 unless $qps; return ($num_running / 100) / $qps;  If you do the dimensional analysis, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, it works.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 22, 2008</span>
        This is a quick informal poll. I&rsquo;d like to know how much network traffic your server receives (not sends), in bytes per second. Give both avg and max if you have them. I&rsquo;m especially interested in hearing about big, heavily loaded systems.
I&rsquo;ll start things off: just by looking at a couple of customer systems, I see one customer&rsquo;s server is at 56k and 79k per second. Another slightly larger one is pulling 76k average and 200k max.

        MySQL just released their new MySQL Query Analyzer (link to a trial), and recently wrote up an interview with Mark Matthews about it. If you haven&rsquo;t read that article, go ahead and do it. I have not used this software, but I fully believe its functionality is quite nice.
But there is at least one alternative, which has been available for a long time. That is the Percona patch-set, plus analysis tools such as mysqlsla or Maatkit&rsquo;s query analysis tools.

A big thanks to Sheeri and others who kept the wheels turning while I was traveling recently.

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been working with a client recently who has <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/">SELinux</a> on his servers.  It has been quite a struggle sometimes.</p>

<p>My colleages tell me that SELinux has a pretty noticeable performance impact.  I am not sure if we have benchmarks to support this; at any rate, the client said it&rsquo;s OK, we&rsquo;ll take the performance hit.</p>

<p>There have been a few problems (Nagios can&rsquo;t run because it can&rsquo;t write to its own pid file, etc etc).  Last night there was something new: &ldquo;too many connections&rdquo; when trying to connect to MySQL.  As a result the site was down, and it wasn&rsquo;t possible to log in to MySQL and see why. But the oddest thing happened: mysqld would not shut down.  It was sitting basically idle, doing absolutely nothing, and wouldn&rsquo;t stop. There was nothing in any log files to show what might be going on.</p>
