        <span class="post-date">Fri, Nov 9, 2007</span>
        The 1.5.2 release of innotop contained two bugs, one very minor. The other was a crash because of the new functionality that aggregates results across many connections. I fixed them and released version 1.6.0, which I consider stable and ready for everyone to use. (My version naming convention for innotop is that even-numbered minor versions are for production use; odd-numbered, such as 1.5.2, are the development branch. That&rsquo;s why I release them under the innotop-devel package).

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Nov 8, 2007</span>
        I created MySQL Table Checksum because I was certain replication replicas were slowly drifting out of sync with their masters, and there was no way to prove it. Once I could prove it, I was able to show that replication gets out of sync for lots of people, lots of times. (If you really want to hear war stories, you should probably talk to one of the MySQL support staff or consulting team members; I&rsquo;m sure they see this a lot more than I do).

        Thanks to a patch Dane Miller submitted, MySQL Heartbeat can now be used to monitor Slony-I replication lag for PostgreSQL. It works identically: it updates a record on the master and looks for it on the replica. You just have to specify the database driver on the command-line:
mysql-heartbeat [options] --dbidriver=Pg Most of the tools in the MySQL Toolkit are very MySQL-specific. This one just happened to be an exception, and I&rsquo;m happy it&rsquo;s useful for more than the original purpose.

        Yep, it&rsquo;s true. &ldquo;MySQL Toolkit&rdquo; technically infringes on MySQL&rsquo;s trademark. I haven&rsquo;t been given a mandate or cease-and-desist order or anything, but as Marten Mickos (MySQL&rsquo;s CEO) told me, anything that starts with the word &ldquo;MySQL&rdquo; sounds like it comes from the company, and this project doesn&rsquo;t come from MySQL.
Suggestions are welcome. I&rsquo;m totally uninspired. &ldquo;Toolkit&rdquo; was the best I could do when I named the project to begin with.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Nov 5, 2007</span>
        Si Chen wrote recently about the growth limits of open-source projects. He points out that as a project becomes larger, it gets harder to maintain. I can only agree. As the MySQL Toolkit project has grown, it&rsquo;s become significantly more work to maintain, document, and enhance.

If you&rsquo;ve used plugins with MySQL Archiver you know that I created a series of &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; where plugins can take some action: before beginning, before archiving each row, etc etc. This lets plugins do things like create new destination tables, aggregate archived rows to summary tables during archiving (great for building data warehouses, though not as sophisticated as Kettle), and so on.

        This release fixes some minor bugs. It also adds a few major new features to several of the tools.

        Last week I wrote about my efforts to measure MySQL&rsquo;s replication speed precisely. The most important ingredient in that recipe was the user-defined function to get the system time with microsecond precision. This post is about that function, which turned out to be surprisingly easy to write.
The manual section on user-defined functions provides very good instructions on how they work and how to build them. But just for the record, on Ubuntu 7.

        Very fast, as it turns out.
While writing the chapter on replication for the upcoming second edition of High Performance MySQL, I decided to do a little test and measure replication speed more accurately than I&rsquo;ve seen others do before. The first edition of the book measured replication speed by inserting on the master and polling on the replica. Giuseppe Maxia later followed up on that by improving the polling process, and found events typically replicated within a half a millisecond.

I&rsquo;m writing about replication filtering rules right now, and I thought it would be good to get input on this. If you have favorite replication filtering tricks you&rsquo;d like to share, or tasks that always frustrate and/or confuse you, please post them in the comments.

It&rsquo;s in detailed outline form at this point (a tactic that has worked very well for us so far &ndash; I&rsquo;ll write about that someday).

        The new release of MySQL Toolkit (version 1051) updates MySQL Parallel Dump in minor ways, but more importantly, it adds MySQL Parallel Restore.
MySQL Parallel Restore is the reverse of MySQL Parallel Dump. You give it one or more files and/or directories, and it discovers all the files contained within them and loads them in parallel. It understands how to load SQL and/or TXT/CSV files. If you give it some of both, it loads the SQL first and then loads the TXT/CSV as delimited files with LOAD DATA INFILE.
