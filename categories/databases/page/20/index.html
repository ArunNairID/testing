        I&rsquo;m going to present on Maatkit at the CPOSC conference in central Pennsylvania on Saturday, October 17th 2009. I&rsquo;ll give an overview of the toolkit, which is no longer an easy task in a single session. I see a number of other interesting sessions have been accepted. It looks like it&rsquo;ll be a good conference.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Aug 23, 2009</span>
        Newer Linux kernels have per-process I/O accounting and you can use the iotop tool to find out what&rsquo;s performing I/O, but in many cases I&rsquo;m trying to find the source of an I/O problem in an older kernel. I found sort of a hack-ish way to do that today, while trying to figure out why a system was basically unresponsive.
I found a post on Stack Overflow that showed a way you can get per process I/O statistics from the kernel even in older kernels.

My wife bought a copy of this book, and recently I took it off her bookshelf to give it a read myself.
I found the book very lucid and readable. The author does not drag us through a bunch of formalisms, nor does she attempt to force the book to be readable through the use of comics, pop-culture references, or other artificial devices.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Aug 18, 2009</span>
        You probably know that it&rsquo;s possible to set configuration variables to log queries that don&rsquo;t use indexes to the slow query log in MySQL. This is a good way to find tables that might need indexes.
But what if the slow query log isn&rsquo;t enabled and you are using (or consulting on) MySQL 5.0 or earlier, where it can&rsquo;t be enabled on the fly unless you&rsquo;re using a patched server such as Percona&rsquo;s enhanced builds?

This is actually quite simple, but for some reason I always find myself confused about how to do it. I have to reason it out all over again, instead of just remembering how to do it.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Aug 8, 2009</span>
        Do you test your application systematically when you upgrade or reconfigure your database server? You should! Here&rsquo;s a real (anonymized) story of what happens if you don&rsquo;t.
 When we upgraded to 5.0.62 (from 5.0.27 and 5.0.45), our code broke for queries like this:
SELECT SUM(amt) FROM daily_amt WHERE day = FROM_UNIXTIME(1222889772);
The problem here was a wrong DATE/DATETIME comparison and other bug fixes in MySQL 5.0.62; it was stricter in enforcing the comparison.

        A while ago I wrote about a tool to help make upgrades safer. Since then, we have gotten several people to help sponsor development on this tool, and a few of our customers are using it to help find problems before they upgrade their systems.
I can&rsquo;t think of a single one of the Maatkit tools that didn&rsquo;t grow out of the need for deeper insight into some part of the system.

We&rsquo;ve released two new tools. These are mk-upgrade and mk-log-player.

        Ryan posted an article on the MySQL Performance Blog about how to use mk-query-digest to analyze and understand your memcached usage with the same techniques you use for MySQL query analysis. This is an idea that came to me during the 2009 MySQL Conference, while talking to our friends from Schooner, who sell a memcached appliance.
It suddenly struck me that the science of memcached performance is basically nonexistent, from the standpoint of developers and architects.

        Suppose that you&rsquo;re writing a new Maatkit tool (just a random example, really) and its job is to measure the difference in execution of queries. The simplest metric is execution time.
Now suppose that you&rsquo;re trying to figure out a metric of badness. The query executes in a second on machine 1 and 1000 seconds on machine 2. That&rsquo;s a pretty bad change. How do you quantify this?
Now you&rsquo;ve got a query that executes in 1ms on machine 1, and 10ms on machine 2.

        Last weekend, my brother and I attended SELF 2009. A few thoughts on it:
The mixture of sessions was interesting. There were some really good ones. I think the best session I attended was an OpenSolaris/NetBeans/Glassfish/Virtualbox/ZFS session, given by a Sun employee. He was an excellent presenter, and really showed off the strengths of the technologies in a nice way. He started up enough VMs to make his OpenSolaris laptop chew into swap, and I thought it was fun to see how it dealt with that.

        Just thought it was worth pointing out that Percona Xtrabackup is not just for XtraDB. It works great for InnoDB tables, too.
So if mysqldump can&rsquo;t handle it anymore, LVM snapshots kill your server and you don&rsquo;t want to buy proprietary backup software, you might take a look at Xtrabackup.

        In the last six months, things have gotten much busier in the world of MySQL performance. That is, making MySQL and InnoDB scale faster out of the box. This is a great trend and I hope it keeps going. At this point I&rsquo;m fighting to find enough time to read about what people are doing; I can&rsquo;t keep up fast enough to actually understand the improvements. That&rsquo;s also good.
The blogs that are posting the most news and analysis are MySQL Performance Blog, Mikael Ronstrom&rsquo;s blog, DimitriK&rsquo;s blog, and Mark Callaghan&rsquo;s blog.

        As you can probably guess, I&rsquo;m catching up on reading my blogs. I&rsquo;ve just read with interest about TokuDB&rsquo;s multiple clustering indexes. It&rsquo;s kind of an obvious thought, once someone has pointed it out to you. I&rsquo;ve only been around products that insist there can be Only One clustered index (and then there&rsquo;s ScaleDB, who say &ldquo;think differently already&rdquo;).
Anyway, we already know that there are quite a few database products that use clustered indexes and to avoid update overhead, require every non-clustered index to store the clustered key as the &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; for row lookups.

While Vadim, Peter and I were writing our blog post on TokuDB, I asked them to provide scholarly references, and they did, but warned me it would be dense reading, in part because it&rsquo;s so academic.

        I&rsquo;ve decided to start writing a book about Maatkit. The working title is Using Maatkit. The goal is to provide another angle onto the tools; the docs are quite good in my opinion, but they only say what the tools do. The book will tell you how to use the toolkit to accomplish tasks.
I have no clue when it&rsquo;ll be done. There is no schedule. At the current rate, it&rsquo;ll take a while.
