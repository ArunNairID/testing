        I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of silly non-standard datetime formats, but this one beats them:
Current Time : 6:11:14 2/19, 2009 Any guesses where that&rsquo;s from?
Hint: think of a command-line tool that also has the silliest non-standard command-line argument format you&rsquo;ve ever seen.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Feb 19, 2009</span>
        I keep reading that Ma.gnolia&rsquo;s data is permanently lost because &ldquo;a specialist had been unable to recover any data from the corrupted hard drive.&rdquo; This is not in itself a reason to consider data completely lost.
It is not clear to me whether the hard drive itself is unusable, e.g. the spindle won&rsquo;t spin and the head won&rsquo;t read the ones and zeroes, or whether the filesystem is corrupted. It sounds to me, from reading Larry Hallf&rsquo;s comments, like it&rsquo;s a simple matter of filesystem corruption.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Feb 17, 2009</span>
        <p>As you may know, MySQL has a dual-licensing model. You can get the source under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPL version 2</a>, or you can buy a commercial license.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been hearing a lot of confusion about when you have to buy a commercial license. People I&rsquo;ve spoken to wrongly believe that they&rsquo;re required to purchase a license if they&rsquo;re going to use MySQL in anything but a not-for-profit business, for example. I don&rsquo;t know how these notions get started, but they do.</p>

<p>So when are you required to buy a commercial license? It&rsquo;s very simple: when you want to do something with MySQL that the GPL doesn&rsquo;t permit.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Feb 12, 2009</span>
        One of the most common patterns I see in my consulting work is identifiers that are generated by MD5() or UUID(). Many times this is done in an application framework or something similar &ndash; not software the client has written. From the application programmer&rsquo;s point of view, it&rsquo;s just an incredibly handy idiom: generate a unique value and use it, you&rsquo;re done.
Those values tend to appear in session identifiers, but that&rsquo;s not the only place; I especially notice them in apps that use Java&rsquo;s Hibernate interfaces, whether session IDs are involved or not.

        After a long time working mostly on Maatkit and neglecting innotop, Aaron Racine has stepped forward to take over the development. I moved it off Sourceforge (for the same reasons I moved Maatkit) and onto Google Code. Aaron has set up mailing lists and so on, and there is a discussion about which features to add and change. Your input is welcomed on the mailing lists!

        It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve sent any news about the MySQL Cacti Templates project I started a while ago. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new:
 VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers MySQL performance monitoring and PostgreSQL performance management among many other features.
  First of all, it&rsquo;s not just MySQL templates anymore.

        Peter Gulutzan and Mark Leith have both written about the new PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA in MySQL. I&rsquo;ve read through the worklog, or most of it &ndash; there were some spots where Firefox seemed to start overlaying parts with other parts, quite weird. But anyway I&rsquo;ve read as much as I can.
Obviously many people have been putting a ton of thought into this for years, and I can&rsquo;t pretend to judge their work in a single sitting.

        So far this year I&rsquo;ve been totally silent about the MySQL Conference and Expo 2009. In the past I&rsquo;ve been a vocal advocate of going to the conference and sending your employees to the conference. So my silence was conspicuous to me, if not to you. I&rsquo;ve always considered myself a strong MySQL supporter and I still do.
Why wasn&rsquo;t I telling people to go to this year&rsquo;s conference? Simple: I can&rsquo;t in good conscience tell people to attend an event from which I&rsquo;ve been excluded (oh, the irony).

        We (Percona) just announced our Percona Performance Conference, and I wanted to tell you a little more about what we hope to accomplish with this conference. Let me show you some simple math that anyone can do.
There&rsquo;s a handy iCal download of the conference schedule on the conference website. iCal is a plain text format that is easy to parse with a scripting language. I downloaded this year&rsquo;s and last year&rsquo;s schedules, and aggregated the number of times each company and speaker is listed as presenting a session.

        Most software changelogs list what&rsquo;s changed and what bugs are fixed during each upgrade. But when you&rsquo;re evaluating an upgrade, what you&rsquo;re typically concerned about is slightly different &ndash; it&rsquo;s a combination of what&rsquo;s changed and what might have broken. The fixed bugs aren&rsquo;t as important for most people, who are either using a workaround or aren&rsquo;t using the software. What people ask is &ldquo;what do I have to change in my application, and/or make sure I&rsquo;m not going to run afoul of, in order to use this new version?

        As Hubert writes, PostgreSQL 8.4 has windowing functions.
Well done. I&rsquo;ve been watching progress on this for a while. It greatly enhances the expressiveness of SQL.
What about common table expressions (WITH and WITH RECURSIVE)? Yes, PostgreSQL 8.4 will have common table expressions (WITH and WITH RECURSIVE) as well. That&rsquo;s the &ldquo;other&rdquo; quantum leap in the expressiveness of SQL in my mind.
Meanwhile I&rsquo;m helping a client rewrite subqueries and finding bugs in MySQL&rsquo;s subquery handling that cause equivalent expressions to return different results.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 20, 2009</span>
        I was just talking to someone who backs up their MySQL servers once a day with mysqldump, and I said in a catastrophe, you&rsquo;re going to have to reload from a backup; that&rsquo;s some amount of downtime, plus up to a day of lost data.
And they said &ldquo;We can just promote a replica, we&rsquo;ve done it before. It works fine.&rdquo;
Granted, in some/many cases, this is fine. There are all sorts of caveats &ndash; for example, you either know that your slave has the same data as the master or you don&rsquo;t care.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 13, 2009</span>
        A while back a Sun engineer posted an article claiming that the best way to scale MySQL is to shard your database in many instances on a single server, each of which runs in threads that individually have low performance. The Sun way has always been to get high throughput with high latency. And that&rsquo;s fine. Others have commented on the real-world applicability of this technique with MySQL, so I won&rsquo;t.

        Mark Wong&rsquo;s entry titled &ldquo;Following up a couple questions from the presentation at PSU on January 8, 2009&rdquo; just caught my eye:
 What is &lsquo;iopp&rsquo;?
It&rsquo;s a custom tool to go through the Linux process table to get i/o statistics per process. It is open source and can be downloaded from:

 If you know me, you know I can&rsquo;t pass up &ldquo;I/O statistics per process.&rdquo; No way. So, after a moment of browsing the code, which is short and to the point, I tried it out:

        This is actually old news, but I never thought to file a bug report (until now) or say anything to anyone about it. If you use mysqldump to dump and restore a MySQL table that has INSERT triggers, you can get different data in your restored database than you had when you dumped. The problem? The tool dumps the triggers before the data, so they get added back to the table before the rows are inserted.

        This post is for people who are trying to roll back unwanted modifications to their MySQL database.
You cannot use the binary logs to undo unwanted changes to your data. The binary logs are for redoing statements, not undoing them. If you have a backup, you may be able to restore the backup and then replay binary logs to roll forward to the desired state. But you cannot roll backwards with the binary logs.
