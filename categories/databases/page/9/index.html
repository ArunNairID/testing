        You can pre-order the new edition of High Performance MySQL now on Amazon or via O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s website.
Eric Bergen called the second edition &ldquo;the best MySQL book on the planet&rdquo;. What will the third edition be called? The best in the solar system? This reminds me of a joke, supposed to be a true story: three pizza restaurants next to each other had signs saying &ldquo;best pizza in town,&rdquo; &ldquo;best pizza in the world,&rdquo; and &ldquo;best pizza on this block.

        As a MySQL consultant, I spend a lot of time talking with people about their backups. More specifically, we talk a lot about recovery. I had an interesting incident myself, which illustrates some of the things that are bound to happen as time passes.
First, let me explain how I do my personal backups. I have a series of external hard drives, which are fully encrypted, as is my computer&rsquo;s hard drive.

        I&rsquo;m researching algorithms for automatic fault detection in MySQL (see my previous post for context). I need real-world data samples to test the algorithm. Can you help by sending me a bit of data from your production server?
The end goal is an open-source tool that will be a standard part of a typical MySQL installation. The problem I&rsquo;m trying to solve for all MySQL users is this: something went wrong, what was it?

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Dec 3, 2011</span>
        I was curious what information MariaDB&rsquo;s &ldquo;phone home&rdquo; user feedback plugin sends. (It works on more than just MariaDB, by the way.)
It&rsquo;s easy enough to find out: just load the plugin, then select from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.FEEDBACK table. This returns a lot of rows that are obviously the status counters and variables, as well as the plugins loaded in the server. A quick exclusion join will eliminate those, and the result on my laptop is this:

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 1, 2011</span>
        Over the course of years, I have observed that the three most sensitive indicators of MySQL having a server lockup are the queries per second, number of connections, and number of queries running. Here is a chart of those three on a production system. Find the bad spot:

I am currently working on developing an automated system that detects abnormal behavior in these three metrics, but doesn&rsquo;t require any a priori inputs or thresholds, e.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Nov 29, 2011</span>
        The pt-query-digest tool has a number of special cases that affect how it &ldquo;fingerprints&rdquo; queries when it groups similar queries together to produce an aggregated report over the group. One of these is a special rule for queries that appear to come from mysqldump, of the following form:
SELECT /*!40001 SQL_NO_CACHE */ * FROM `users` All such queries will be fingerprinted together and presented in a single class of queries. I remember many instances where mysqldump queries crowded the report of the &ldquo;most important&rdquo; queries and just caused other queries to be excluded.

        The third edition is nearly done. I&rsquo;ve committed first drafts of all chapters, and all but one appendix. I need to do the last appendix and then rewrite the preface, which is a few days of work at my current pace. After that, it&rsquo;s the usual tech review, copyediting, updates to figures, etc &ndash; and then it&rsquo;s off to production.
I&rsquo;m really pleased with this edition. I was planning on it just being a refresh of the second edition to reflect what&rsquo;s new in MySQL-land, but it&rsquo;s almost a complete rewrite.

        One of the things I think we did right with Maatkit (and now with Percona Toolkit) is making the documentation part of the code itself. So much redundancy and wrong documentation has been eliminated by making the tool actually read its own documentation when it starts up. As an example, the default value of the &#8211;shorten option is defined in the documentation (it&rsquo;s Perldoc) like this:
=item --shorten type: int; default: 1024  Not only is the documentation part of the code, but the tool&rsquo;s &#8211;help output is generated from it too.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 19, 2011</span>
        Blackhole tables are often used on a so-called &ldquo;relay replica&rdquo; where some operation needs to happen but no data needs to exist. This used to have a bug that prevented AUTO_INCREMENT columns from propagating the right values through replication, but that was fixed. It turns out there&rsquo;s another bug, though, that has the same effect. This one is caused when there is an INSERT into a Blackhole table, where the source data is SELECT-ed from another Blackhole table.

With five concurrent tracks, it&rsquo;s tough to decide. This is roughly the equivalent of the MySQL conference every year, which has more tracks, but historically it&rsquo;s been easy to cross off some talks as sales pitches.

Here&rsquo;s an abstract of what you&rsquo;ll learn:
Everyone wants to prevent database downtime by being proactive, but how effective are the common measures such as inspecting logs and analyzing SQL? To be truly proactive, one must prevent problems, which requires studying and understanding the reasons for downtime.

        I had some conversations with a few people at Oracle Open World about features that would be beneficial in InnoDB. They encouraged me to blog my thoughts, so I am.
Someday I&rsquo;d like to have a clear mental list of features I want in MySQL in general, but that is a much harder list to organize and prioritize. InnoDB is an easier place to get started.
First, I&rsquo;d like truly online, nonblocking DDL.

        A few people have asked me how it&rsquo;s going, so I thought I&rsquo;d just share it with everyone. Things are going great. I&rsquo;m writing much more quickly than I thought I would be, and as a result I&rsquo;m finding I have time to do more changes than I thought I could, which makes me happy. I should be finished drafting the chapters by the end of the year.
In particular, the faster than expected pace is giving me a chance to address one of the big weaknesses of the second edition.

        I was looking into the history about why SYSDATE() and NOW() behave differently in MySQL, and it looks like in 4.0 and 4.1 they used to be the same. But as of MySQL 5.0, SYSDATE() was changed to emulate Oracle&rsquo;s behavior, that is, it returns the time as of the function execution, not as of the statement start.
There are a number of bug reports related to this: 15101, 12480, 12481, and 12562.

Instrumentation can be a lot of work to add to a server, and it can add overhead to the server too. The bits of instrumentation I&rsquo;ll advocate in this post are few and trivial, but disproportionately powerful.
 Note: VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production.

I presented on three things: a lightning talk about causes of MySQL downtime; I chaired a panel on Big Data and the Cloud; and I showed how to derive scalability and performance metrics from TCP traffic. I&rsquo;ve sent my slides to the Surge organizers, and I understand that they will be posting them as well as integrating them into the video of my session.

        I&rsquo;ve been seeing a few occasions where Neil J. Gunther&rsquo;s Universal Scalability Law doesn&rsquo;t seem to model all of the important factors in a system as it scales. Models are only models, and they&rsquo;re not the whole truth, so they never match reality perfectly. But there appear to be a small number of cases where systems can actually scale a bit better than linearly over a portion of the domain, due to what I&rsquo;ve been calling an &ldquo;economy of scale.
