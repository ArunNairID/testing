        <span class="post-date">Thu, Apr 5, 2007</span>
        I&rsquo;ve just released three updates to tools in MySQL Toolkit. The updated programs are MySQL Query Profiler (major new features and helper script), MySQL Table Sync (bug fixes, documentation, features), and MySQL Table Checksum (minor sanity check enhancement).
MySQL Query Profiler 1.1.0 I&rsquo;ve added the ability to profile more data, including an educated guess at the number of filesorts.
The tool can now profile external programs. There are several ways you can do this:

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 2, 2007</span>
        I wrote an article late last week about benchmark results for the two table-synchronization algorithms I&rsquo;ve been implementing for the MySQL Table Sync tool. I&rsquo;ve spent some time developing a test suite for the tool, and learned some really interesting things about the general problem of synchronizing tables.
Progress on MySQL Table Sync My test suite caught some great bugs, but not as many as I&rsquo;d expected, which is a great feeling.

        I&rsquo;ve been working on how to efficiently compare and synchronize data between two tables on different MySQL servers. I&rsquo;ve also been working on a tool, sort of like rsync for database tables, which implements both algorithms. I profiled it to see how well the comparison algorithms work on real data. This article is about the results.
The data and profiling results I used a sample of real data from a production database.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Mar 25, 2007</span>
        MySQL Table Maintainer is a new utility to help you run table maintenance commands (ANALYZE, CHECK, OPTIMIZE, REPAIR) on your MySQL tables. It&rsquo;s part of the MySQL toolkit.
Overview This tool is designed to help you run maintenance commands on your MySQL tables. There is a MySQL-provided tool (myisamchk) that fills some of the same purposes, but there are important advantages to doing it with SQL commands instead. Unlike using myisamchk, you don&rsquo;t have to ensure this tool has exclusive access to the tables!

        I&rsquo;ve just released updates to all the tools in the MySQL Toolkit. The biggest change I made to most packages is using DBD to read MySQL&rsquo;s option files, though some packages got more significant updates.
Overview I discovered some features I didn&rsquo;t know the Perl MySQL driver had &ndash; features to read MySQL&rsquo;s option files, mostly, though there are some other nice features I use occasionally (but which are very relevant to innotop).

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Mar 19, 2007</span>
        MySQL Toolkit&rsquo;s Show Grants tool can now separate grants into individual statements, convert them into REVOKE statements, and help you remove users from a server, even if your server doesn&rsquo;t support DROP USER.
Changes The comment on my last post, combined with my need to revoke some grants today on a server that accidentally got grants replicated to it, prompted me to add more functionality to this tool. It can now:

        MySQL Table Sync efficiently finds and resolves data (not structural) differences between two MySQL tables, which may be on different servers. It offers two search algorithms to find the rows that differ, and several methods to bring the destination table into sync with the source.
It&rsquo;s based on my earlier discussion on how to find and resolve data differences between MySQL tables and is part of the MySQL Toolkit project.

        MySQL Toolkit&rsquo;s Show Grants tool makes it easy to extract grants from a MySQL server in canonical form. You can use it to replicate grants between servers, diff grants, and avoid spurious changesets in version control systems. It&rsquo;s part of the Maatkit project on Google Code.
It&rsquo;s a fairly simple tool that connects to a MySQL server, issues SHOW GRANTS, and prints the results. By default it prints grants for every user, but you can specify users to show and users to ignore.

        I&rsquo;m continuing to add new tools to the MySQL Toolkit. MySQL Deadlock Logger is for extracting and storing information about the latest recorded InnoDB deadlock. It&rsquo;s not only easy to view the information from the command line, it&rsquo;s dead simple to store it back into a MySQL table for analysis. I think most users will find it handy to create a cron job to record the deadlocks automatically for later analysis.

        Are you seeing a MySQL error that says InnoDB support isn&rsquo;t enabled, even though it is? This article explains why it happens and how to fix it.
The symptom Suppose you call SHOW INNODB STATUS or another InnoDB-specific command and MySQL reports the following error:
&ldquo;ERROR 1235 (42000): Cannot call SHOW INNODB STATUS because skip-innodb is defined&rdquo;
Yet you search the MySQL configuration files and find that&rsquo;s not true. And you know you have InnoDB tables, too.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Mar 5, 2007</span>
        I&rsquo;ve been designing an algorithm to resolve data differences between MySQL tables, specifically so I can &lsquo;patch&rsquo; a replication replica that has gotten slightly out of sync without completely re-initializing it. I intend to create a tool that can identify which rows are different and bring them into sync. I would like your thoughts on this.
Background and requirements I see this as the next step in my recent series of posts on MySQL tools and techniques to keep replication running reliably and smoothly.

I&rsquo;ve set up an innotop-discuss mailing list, which I hope you&rsquo;ll find a better way to get support than posting in the comments on this blog.

 Manage many servers at once conveniently. Powerful filters, expressions, colorizing rules, and sorting. Better error handling. More modes, such as a mode to monitor and control replication. Much more.  Much gratitude is due the people who&rsquo;ve helped, especially Sebastien Estienne, Christian Hammers, Steven Kreuzer and other people who&rsquo;ve helped design features, make packages, get innotop distributed more widely, and give me advice on such things as Makefiles.

Thank you all for your feedback, and welcome to Ruslan Zakirov, who plans to add some new tools!
Updated packages are now on Sourceforge. All three packages needed minor tweaks, so I bumped the version numbers to 1.

        I&rsquo;ve updated MySQL Query Profiler, which I consider the most important tool I&rsquo;ve written. It&rsquo;s now included as part of the MySQL Toolkit project on Sourceforge.
The updates are mainly small bug fixes, and I reviewed the documentation as well. Since I&rsquo;ve been using it for a while and didn&rsquo;t change much, I have decided to release it as version 1.0.0.
At some point I may extend it to address the new storage engines being developed for MySQL 5.

        MySQL Table Checksum is a tool to efficiently verify the contents of any MySQL table in any storage engine. You can use it to compare tables across many servers at once. The output is friendly and easy to use, both by eyeball and in UNIX command-line scripts. The provided MySQL Checksum Filter helps you winnow output so you only see tables that have problems.
MySQL Table Checksum Following up on my earlier article about how to calculate a table checksum in MySQL, I&rsquo;ve integrated that methodology, with improvements suggested by the commenters and others, into a single easy-to-use tool.

A reader wrote in with a question about how to find how much traffic has passed through a network interface. The reader has a script that samples the interface&rsquo;s statistics and stores them in a database. The statistics wrap back around when they exceed the maximum size of an integer, so it&rsquo;s not a strictly increasing sequence.
