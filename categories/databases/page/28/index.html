        <span class="post-date">Thu, Apr 10, 2008</span>
        This year&rsquo;s conference has a great lineup. As usual, with 8 sessions concurrently, it&rsquo;s impossible to pick which ones I want to see. However, I did learn a few things from last year&rsquo;s conference, which I think will help me get more out of it this time.
Number one rule: not all sessions are created equal. I can&rsquo;t say for sure, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that when you see &ldquo;How Product X Will Scale Your Databases&rdquo; presented by a person from Company X, you can reasonably suspect that Company X is paying for this privilege, and it&rsquo;s not really a session as much as a product demo.

        Just a quick note: Kickfire is not based on SSD (solid-state device) hard drives. Their old website says &ldquo;SQL goes solid state&rdquo; but that just means SQL in hardware, not SSD.
When I was a child, we had a Sears Lady Kenmore clothes washing machine that boasted &ldquo;solid-state circuits&rdquo; on the panel, in flowery script writing. It was not based on SSD, either.
Finally, I am not on the Kickfire payroll.

        Some of you have noticed Kickfire, a new sponsor at this year&rsquo;s MySQL Conference and Expo. Like Keith Murphy, I have been involved with them for a while now. This article explains the basics of how their technology is different from the current state of the art in complex queries on large amounts of data.
Kickfire is developing a MySQL appliance that combines a pluggable storage engine (for MySQL 5.

        As a I wrote a couple of days ago, I went to the second day of PostgreSQL Conference East 2008 last Sunday. I had a good time and really enjoyed meeting everyone, listening, learning, and occasionally talking. I asked a number of fearless-newbie questions that paid off handsomely: people were very willing to humor me. I also left with a beautiful t-shirt, mug, and bag combo thanks to EnterpriseDB. The bag has already been put to use for a grocery shopping trip.

        My wife wants to learn database design. She is an archaeologist. She wants to read a book written in plain English, not h4x0r jargon. She is smart and capable and knows her own data, but does not know SQL or database theory. She wants to be able to design databases and be understood by others who know database design. She also wants to be able to explain her ideas to a programmer who will build the systems she&rsquo;s designing.

        I&rsquo;m heading out to PostgreSQL Conference East in a few hours. Alas, I missed the first day but I&rsquo;ll be there all day tomorrow. I hope to learn, meet people, and generally participate in goodness.
And no, I&rsquo;m not an expert in PostgreSQL as I am in MySQL, but I have always held it in very high esteem. I am not going to try to spread the MySQL-ness into the PostgreSQL camp :-)

        Just a quick note to say we have reached the production stage of the book project. Production is the process of transforming our OpenOffice.org files into the final page layout using a professional typesetting program.
As you can probably guess, this is later than we would have wished. This also means we won&rsquo;t have the book for sale at the upcoming MySQL Conference and Expo. We will have a display copy at the O&rsquo;Reilly booth at the conference, and you will be able to pre-order the book at a discount at that booth.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Mar 9, 2008</span>
        I wrote a User-Defined Function that implements the FNV (Fowler-Voll-No) hash function for MySQL. I&rsquo;m not the first person to do this &ndash; in fact, I was inspired by the Google patches for MySQL. But my implementation is a little bit different from most, in a very important way that leads directly to much higher performance, especially suited for the Maatkit tools.
A bit of background: FNV hashing is a very fast hash algorithm that operates in fixed memory.

        A lot of people contact me asking if I&rsquo;m looking for a job. (I have an unanswered email in my inbox right now.) People are looking desperately for qualified, knowledgeable MySQL professionals. There&rsquo;s a critical shortage of people who can admin MySQL moderately well, much less at the guru level.
If you are one of the many who are trying to hire a MySQL DBA, you should send your employees to the MySQL Conference and Expo.

        Suppose you have a master-master replication setup, and you know one of the tables has the wrong data. How do you re-sync it with the other server?
Warning: don&rsquo;t just use any tool for this job! You may destroy your good copy of the data.
If your table is large, you&rsquo;ll probably want to use a tool that can smartly find the differences in a very large dataset, and fix only the rows that need to be fixed.

        Jason Hull of OpenSource Connections, a company in my town, posted an article on what Sun&rsquo;s acquisition of MySQL means for the US government. I thought Planet MySQL readers might appreciate a different angle on the issue than many of the Planet MySQL posts, which are often focused on business or community more than government. (I&rsquo;m just passing the link along, not agreeing or disagreeing).

As a proposal reviewer, I looked at and voted on 250+ proposals for sessions and tutorials for this conference. There are going to be some great sessions and tutorials.[1]
If you haven&rsquo;t come to the conference previously, it&rsquo;s well worth your time and money, in my opinion.

        I dashed off a hasty post about speeding up replication replicas, and gave no references or explanation. That&rsquo;s what happens when I write quickly! This post explains what the heck I was talking about.
I first heard Paul Tuckfield talk at the first MySQL Camp, in November 2006. He mentioned that he speeds up MySQL replication by &ldquo;pre-fetching relay logs&rdquo; on the replica. Actually, I think he used the term &ldquo;pipelining&rdquo; at that point.

        Paul Tuckfield of YouTube has spoken about how he sped up his replicas by pre-fetching the replica&rsquo;s relay logs. I wrote an implementation of this, tried it on my workload, and it didn&rsquo;t speed them up. (I didn&rsquo;t expect it to; I don&rsquo;t have the right workload). I had a few email exchanges with Paul and some other experts on the topic and we agreed my workload isn&rsquo;t going to benefit from the pre-fetching.

I just finished revising the last two major chapters that Peter Zaitsev hasn&rsquo;t yet reviewed. Peter has been essentially going through the chapters like a very thorough technical reviewer. He makes corrections, points out where things aren&rsquo;t clear or need examples, and adds more material.
