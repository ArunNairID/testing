        <span class="post-date">Wed, Mar 7, 2012</span>
        I&rsquo;m at Hotsos Symposium this week, and it suddenly occurred to me that a lot of Oracle DBAs who are beginning to manage MySQL servers might have some things to share with others in a similar role shift:
 Familiar, comfortable tools and techniques, or capabilities of the Oracle Database, that you miss in MySQL Equivalents or replacements for the aforementioned  Do you have anything to share with your fellow DBAs going through ODT (Oracle Delerium Tremens)?

        Thinking about a new career? Percona is hiring for a variety of positions. Sales, server engineering, training, consulting, support, and occasionally other things too.
It&rsquo;s a great place to work. I&rsquo;m totally biased, but it&rsquo;s still a great place to work.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Mar 7, 2012</span>
        Someone asked me yesterday why there are no TPC benchmarks for MySQL. By &ldquo;benchmarks&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;benchmark tools&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;official benchmark results.&rdquo; For example, see the current TPC-C benchmarks. Any true TPC benchmark has to be certified by the TPC and is an arduous and expensive process. Is it time for MySQL to play in this theater? Or does it simply not matter?

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Mar 2, 2012</span>
        If you haven&rsquo;t booked your hotel room yet, you should do it ASAP. The hotel is going to raise their rates at the same time the early-bird conference rate expires. This is a coincidence: Percona has no control over hotel prices. (There is a group discount rate, but we don&rsquo;t call the shots on that.)
A good rule of thumb is that if you&rsquo;re thinking about traveling somewhere, you should book your hotel immediately, and cancel if you change your mind.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Mar 2, 2012</span>
        When people ask me about high availability, I often suggest that it&rsquo;s helpful to understand whether you&rsquo;re most interested in service availability, data availability, or both. Of course, you want both &ndash; but if cost is an object, you may end up relaxing your requirements.
The typical example of an application that needs service availability but doesn&rsquo;t have strong data availability requirements is something that&rsquo;s ad-supported. Who cares if the last few comments on funny cat photos are lost?

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Feb 28, 2012</span>
        MySQL 5.6 is going to have a lot of improvements. I want to mention a few things I think are uniquely valuable for a large set of typical MySQL users.
The first is index condition pushdown. If you&rsquo;ve read High Performance MySQL, you saw a lengthy &ldquo;indexing case study&rdquo; in the chapter on indexing. It&rsquo;s many pages of if-this-then-that kinds of things: you have to include this column in the index, but then in that order, but only for this query because for this other query you need these other indexes with columns in these orders, and this index can be suitable for these queries if you combine some other things, and it just goes on and on.

 VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production. It does TCP network traffic analysis. VividCortex offers MySQL performance monitoring and PostgreSQL performance management among many other features.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Feb 9, 2012</span>
        After the recent update to pt-table-checksum, I&rsquo;ve seen a few FAQs about it.
Q: is it still multi-threaded/parallel? A: No, that was a pile of bugs and complexity. If you need to run the tool in parallel to take advantage of powerful hardware, you can run several instances, say, one per database.
Q: what chunk size should I use? A: None, let the tool adjust itself dynamically.
Q: what if it skips a table or chunk because it&rsquo;s oversized?

        It might surprise you to hear this, but I had no idea whether my talks would be accepted. The committee decided on that, and neither I nor anyone else at Percona is on the committee.

This seems like an appropriate place to mention a few words about the conference organization.

        Schooner has a blog post showing that one node of their product beats 9 nodes of Clustrix&rsquo;s in throughput. But this reduces everything to a single number, and that&rsquo;s not everything that matters. If you&rsquo;ve looked at Vadim&rsquo;s white paper about Clustrix&rsquo;s (paid-for) performance evaluation with Percona, you see there is a lot of detail about how consistent the throughput and response time are.
I&rsquo;d love to see that level of details in any product comparison.

        Join me Wednesday for a free webinar on using the new Percona Toolkit v2.0.3 to verify replication integrity. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with this topic, it&rsquo;s one of those must-do things that no one officially tells you is necessary with MySQL. The new tools in Percona Toolkit 2.0.3 make it much easier and less complicated &ndash; and safer &ndash; than before. Well worth an hour of your time.
