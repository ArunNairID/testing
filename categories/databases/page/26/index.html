        <span class="post-date">Sat, Aug 2, 2008</span>
        Just thought I&rsquo;d update you. We got quite a few good errata from readers, and I took a couple weekends and went through the book with a fine-toothed comb, catching typos and subtle errors that crept in at some point (TPC benchmarks were labeled as TCP benchmarks &ndash; did you catch that one?). I marked up my book and mailed it to O&rsquo;Reilly, who went well above and beyond what they normally do for errata.

        Hooray! The MySQL reference manual has a new search system. It now uses a Google Appliance and the results should be a lot better. The old system was not very helpful. It used to break config variables into multiple words and search on them individually and give a billion results I didn&rsquo;t care about. I&rsquo;ve just tried to search for some things like key_buffer_size and got results I think are very useful.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Jul 28, 2008</span>
        Someone who should know told me that LinkedIn runs its main application on Oracle. So when I saw the press release about MySQL being their database, I read carefully, and they are not very specific about exactly what MySQL is used for. Depending on how you read it, you could argue that they left open the possibility that the main application database is not MySQL, and the MySQL deal is for something peripheral.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Jul 23, 2008</span>
        My editor Andy Oram recently sent me an ACM article on BASE, a technique for improving scalability by being willing to give up some other properties of traditional transactional systems.
It&rsquo;s a really good read. In many ways it is the same religion everyone who&rsquo;s successfully scaled a system Really Really Big has advocated. But this is different: it&rsquo;s a very clear article, with a great writing style that really cuts out the fat and teaches the principles without being specific to any environment or sounding egotistical.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Jul 17, 2008</span>
        I have been getting a lot of comments and errata from people who seem to be mistakenly buying the first edition and believing it&rsquo;s the second edition. A lot of the blame for this probably rests with Amazon, who did not distinguish between the two editions at all until the editor and I (among others) leaned on them persistently for about 6 weeks. I think some people are buying the second edition and getting the first edition.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jul 15, 2008</span>
        Apparently High Performance MySQL, 2nd Edition is selling quite well &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how well &ndash; because we&rsquo;re preparing for a second printing. This makes me very happy. I don&rsquo;t think they anticipated going back to the press for quite some time.
The book fluctuates between sales rank 1000 and 2000 on Amazon during the day, and has reached as high as 600 or so. This is just phenomenal.

        The Sphinx project just released version 0.9.8, with many enhancements since the previous release. There&rsquo;s never been a better time to try it out. It&rsquo;s really cool technology.
What is Sphinx? Glad you asked. It&rsquo;s fast, efficient, scalable, relevant full-text searching and a heck of a lot more. In fact, Sphinx complements MySQL for a lot of non-search queries that MySQL frankly isn&rsquo;t very good at, including WHERE clauses on low-selectivity columns, ORDER BY with a LIMIT and OFFSET, and GROUP BY.

        Dear reader, this is a challenge. How&rsquo;s your MySQL prowess? You know about LIMIT: it cuts off the results at the specified number.
mysql&gts; select actor_id from sakila.actor where actor_id % 5 = 0 limit 5; +----------+ | actor_id | +----------+ | 5 | | 10 | | 15 | | 20 | | 25 | +----------+ 5 rows in set (0.00 sec) But that query actually accessed 25 rows. What if I want to say &ldquo;return up to 5 rows, but don&rsquo;t read any more than 20 rows to find them?

        The book is done now, right? What&rsquo;s next?
Don&rsquo;t tell my wife this, but a book is never done.
Right now I&rsquo;m proofreading the printed copy. I proofread PDF after PDF during production, but some problems will always slip through and make it to paper. I&rsquo;m finding quite a few little mistakes. For example, at one point we refer to TPC as TCP three times in a row. Oops.
These problems will be corrected in the next printing.

        Percona is looking to hire someone to develop Maatkit, among other things.
If I weren&rsquo;t having so much fun being the consulting team lead, I&rsquo;d be doing it myself. (In fact, I&rsquo;m still hacking on it a lot. Got some pretty fun stuff done this weekend.) I don&rsquo;t know what the rest of the world thinks, but I think Maatkit is a damn enjoyable project to work on. Hopefully someone else will have the same kind of mindset and want to get paid for it, unlike poor working-on-the-weekends me.

I got a lot of responses from it and learned some neat things I wouldn&rsquo;t have learned if I hadn&rsquo;t written the post. I also got a lot of questions, and my editor wrote a response too. I want to follow up on these things.

        The other day I was explaining options to someone who wanted to know about archiving data in MySQL. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I might have to code my app to look for the data in two places?&rdquo; The disadvantage of this is that his app might be more complex. Another disadvantage is that it might take two queries &ndash; if you look for a user in the usual location and it&rsquo;s not there, you have to look for it elsewhere.

        Today High Performance MySQL, Second Edition went to press. I&rsquo;ve been working with the production team over the last couple of weeks, proofreading and checking the index and working with the artist who re-drew the illustrations.
I spoke to the production editor this morning and she told me the schedule is for the bound-book date to be the 16th of June. The official in-stock date is June 19th. I don&rsquo;t know how many copies they&rsquo;re printing for the first printing.

        Before I tell you what&rsquo;s new, let me tell you how cool I think it would be if Maatkit were voted Sourceforge.net project of the year. Just something to think about :-) I suggest the &ldquo;Best Tool or Utility for SysAdmins&rdquo; category. You can actually click the Back button and nominate it for several categories. Not that anyone would do that, of course.
Also, if anyone wants to jump in and help out with bug fixes and new features, please, by all means.

        In preparation for the book&rsquo;s launch next month, I&rsquo;ve created a website for it: High Performance MySQL. You may notice that the URL isn&rsquo;t the same as the site for the first edition. It proved to be difficult to transfer that domain. If we accomplish it later on, I&rsquo;ll set up a redirect.
Why an official site? To give you free stuff, of course. Final drafts of the front matter (TOC, preface, foreword), a sample chapter, and the index are there already.

        MySQL's version numbering is getting harder and harder to understand. In fact, it's getting surreal.
Let me state up front that there's probably a lot I don't know here. But if I don't know, how on earth can the general public figure it out?
Before we begin, let's define terms: GA is completely done, ready for use. RC is a release candidate: don't change anything, just fix bugs because we're charging towards a release here.
