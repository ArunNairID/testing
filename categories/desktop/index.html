        <span class="post-date">Fri, Apr 3, 2015</span>
        <p>I used Google Reader since time out of mind, but of course by now you know it
was discontinued a while ago. I still live and breathe RSS feeds, and I really
don&rsquo;t pay much attention to social media, news sites, or the like of Hacker News
and Slashdot. I like the flexibility and unhurried pace of subscribing to
updates from specific individuals and companies.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2015/04/grapes.jpg" alt="Grapes" /></p>

<p>At first, I didn&rsquo;t see a reader that offered the experience I was looking for: a
GMail-like user interface with feeds clustered together in categories, navigable
with keystrokes. Importantly, some subtle features such as marking an item
unread are a key part of my usage.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 1, 2014</span>
        <p>You&rsquo;re creating a document with Word that you want to turn into a nice full-page PDF. It has a gorgeous background color that will look great. But every time you convert it to a PDF, it ends up with ugly white borders at the edges, and Word warns you about printing beyond the printable margins. Dragging the margins and changing the Page Setup options does no good. How can you fix this?</p>

        I used to use the FireGPG extension to encrypt and decrypt text in a browser &ndash; including wikis, for example, where sensitive client information could be stored. It&rsquo;s been a while since I had that need, but recently I wanted to send a GPG-encrypted message to a coworker, and FireGPG has been discontinued for years. I also use a Mac now, and Chrome is my primary browser.
What to do? I looked around at a few Chrome extensions, but didn&rsquo;t really like them.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Nov 20, 2012</span>
        Terminal-based, keystroke-driven editors are enormously powerful, and I still haven&rsquo;t seen anything more powerful than Vim. I&rsquo;m a longtime Vim user, and although I&rsquo;m not the world&rsquo;s foremost jaw-dropping expert on Vim, I would call myself an advanced power user at the very least, and probably a true expert. Still, I have maintained a relationship with GUI text editors over the years, too. An editor that has an insertion point for a cursor, and &ldquo;native&rdquo; mouse interaction, has an appeal I&rsquo;ve never quite shaken.

        I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve said this before, but I absolutely love VirtualBox. It makes it so easy to run Windows in the cases where I have to for a client&rsquo;s silly Windows-only VPN software or something like that. Windows runs better inside VirtualBox than it does on bare hardware.
One of the tricks I use constantly is to set up a bunch of VirtualBox instances with a common (shared) base disk image.

        I recently set up the solarized color theme for my terminal emulator. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do this for a while, but procrastinated. However, I finally got really frustrated with the colors I get from &ldquo;ls&rdquo; sometimes &ndash; I use a dark terminal with light fonts, and the directory listings in particular can become invisible, with dark blue on black.
Solarized is much improved. All of the colors work well together and are easy on the eyes.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jun 28, 2011</span>
        tl;dr version: I like XFCE better than Gnome 3.
I wrote previously about trying out Gnome 3. I&rsquo;ve been using it for about a month now, and it&rsquo;s time for me to make a decision about whether to keep using it or revert to Gnome 2. I&rsquo;m actually on vacation, which ends soon. I need to do this before vacation ends, so I can be fully productive at work.
My ultimate impression of Gnome 3 is that it&rsquo;s very slick, and makes significant improvements in some ways, but it&rsquo;s not very usable for my purposes, and has too many self-contradictions.

        Thanks to a comment on a recent blog post where I lamented the lack of an easy-to-use password manager, I&rsquo;ve switched from Revelation to&hellip; Vim.
I already use Vim for my note-keeping system. I simply add a modeline to the top of the file,
# vim: set ic hlsearch: This makes searches case-insensitive, so I can just open the file and start typing a search, and it highlights it and moves to the first match as I type.

        I finally upgraded from Fedora 13 to Fedora 15 on my beloved ASUS-UL30A-X5. It includes the new Gnome 3, with the &ldquo;Gnome Shell&rdquo; interface. It&rsquo;s quite different from anything else I&rsquo;ve used, and you can read lots of positive and negative impressions around the web.
Fedora 15 and Gnome 3 have awesome support for my laptop&rsquo;s hardware. It&rsquo;s simply flawless. You could not expect better software/hardware integration if you paid thousands of dollars for something from Steve Jobs.

        If you&rsquo;ve used OpenOffice.org Impress to run a slideshow with your laptop plugged into an external monitor or projector, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed that it prefers to switch the primary and secondary display, showing you the slideshow while it shows your audience the notes and preview of your next slide! This is exactly the reverse of what you want, which is to show your audience the slideshow and let you see notes, the countdown timer, and so on.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 5, 2010</span>
        This weekend I backed up all my data, repartitioned my hard drive, and re-installed. I needed to do this because the only thing I had on the laptop was Ubuntu, and sadly, the reality is sometimes my clients use things that require me to use Windows (and sometimes a virtual machine won&rsquo;t solve that). So now I&rsquo;m dual-booting Windows. I think the last time I did that was sometime before 2001, so I&rsquo;ve regressed 9 years.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, May 26, 2009</span>
        One of the minor things I&rsquo;ve noticed when I use Thunderbird on my IMAP accounts is that it doesn&rsquo;t download IMAP messages until I click on them. Then I have to wait until I can see the message. I have heard that this is supposed to be fixed in Thunderbird 3, and I tried it but a lot of the extensions I need aren&rsquo;t compatible with it.
Today I finally tried to search and find out more about the problem.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Jan 29, 2009</span>
        Thunderbird&rsquo;s email search isn&rsquo;t that great by today&rsquo;s standards. If I type &ldquo;red dog&rdquo; into the search bar it doesn&rsquo;t even tokenize and search for the words separately &ndash; it&rsquo;s a substring match so &ldquo;my dog is red&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t found. And it&rsquo;s slow.
What about embedding &ldquo;real&rdquo; fulltext search into it? Sphinx perhaps?
Just a thought.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 1, 2008</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;m really really happy about <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu 8.10</a> because it lets me stop kicking myself so much for buying a Dell Inspiron 1501. This little laptop was the el-cheapo option for me, found via <a href="http://www.dealnews.com/">dealnews.com</a>. I was going to buy the virtually identical one that came with Ubuntu installed, but then Dell offered a deal on the 1501, which had Windows Vista, and I caved in to the allure of saving about $200.</p>

<p>Of course I promptly discovered that the two most important differences between the models involved hardware for which no good Free Software drivers existed: the video card and the wireless card. The Inspiron 1501 has a &ldquo;ATI Technologies Inc RS482 [Radeon Xpress 200M]&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Broadcom Corporation BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN (rev 01)&rdquo;.</p>

 I tried the xorg driver, which had been working fine on just the laptop display, but it wouldn&rsquo;t work; I could get either the external display or the internal display to show, but not both. If you get it working, post a comment and let me know.

What are stepping slides? &ldquo;Stepping&rdquo; slides are the only animation or transition effect I allow myself in slideshows. I don&rsquo;t generally like animations or other distractions; when I give talks, I am always painfully conscious of how much the audience tends to focus on the slides.

        I recently bought a Dell Inspiron 1501, which I got a great deal on thanks to the fine people at DealNews. The base system was $449 shipped, and I chose to upgrade the processor to dual AMD64s. But I didn&rsquo;t buy the system that came with Ubuntu pre-installed; for whatever reason, the one that came with Windows offered a special discount (normally the Windows tax for otherwise identical machines appears to be around $150, and I&rsquo;m certainly not going to run Windows).
