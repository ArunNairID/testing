        <span class="post-date">Sun, Oct 30, 2016</span>
        <p>Computer systems, and for that matter all types of systems that receive requests
and process them, have a response time that includes some time waiting in queue
if the server is busy when a request arrives. The wait time increases sharply as
the server gets busier. For simple M/M/m systems there is a simple equation that
describes this exactly, but for more complicated systems this equation is only
approximate. This has rattled around in my brain for a long time, and rather
than keeping my notes private I&rsquo;m sharing them here (although since I&rsquo;m still
trying to learn this stuff I may just be putting my ignorance on full display).</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Dec 6, 2015</span>
        <p>I often see benchmark reports that show charts but don&rsquo;t provide tables of
numeric results. Some people will make the actual measurements available if
asked, but I&rsquo;ve been interested in
<a href="https://www.vividcortex.com/resources/universal-scalability-law/">analyzing</a>
many systems for which I can&rsquo;t get numbers.  Fortunately, it&rsquo;s usually possible
to get approximate results without too much trouble. In this blog post I&rsquo;ll show
several ways to extract estimates of values from a chart image.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Jan 31, 2013</span>
        I have often seen people fitting curves to sets of data without first understanding whether that is appropriate. I once even used this blog to criticize someone for doing that.
I was trying to explain that it&rsquo;s wrong to fit a model to a set of measurements, unless the model actually describes the process that produced the measurements.
All of my explanations (and rants) have fallen far short of the clarity and simplicity of this curve-fitting guide.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Jan 7, 2013</span>
        I&rsquo;ve written a lot about modeling MySQL with the USL, and I like it best of all the scalability models I&rsquo;ve seen, but it&rsquo;s not the only way to think about scalability. I was aware that New Relic supports a scalability chart, so I decided to take a peek at that. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of the chart, from their blog:
Here&rsquo;s how it works. It plots response time (or database time, or CPU) as the dependent variable, versus throughput as the independent variable.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 5, 2013</span>
        Last time I said that you can set a starting value for the USL&rsquo;s coefficient of performance and let your modeling software (R, gnuplot, etc) manipulate this as part of the regression to find the best fit. However, there is a subtlety in the USL model that you need to be aware of. Here is a picture of the low-end of the curve:
The graph shows the USL model as the blue curve and linear scalability as the black line.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Jan 3, 2013</span>
        Last time I said that the USL has a forgotten third coefficient, the coefficient of performance. This is the same thing as the system&rsquo;s throughput at concurrency=1, or C(1). How do you determine this coefficient? There are at least three ways.
Neil Gunther&rsquo;s writings, or at least those that I&rsquo;ve read and remember, say that you should set it equal to your measurement of C(1). Most of his writing discusses a handful of measurements of the system: one at concurrency 1, and at least 4 to 6 at higher concurrencies.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Jan 2, 2013</span>
        If you&rsquo;re familiar with Neil Gunther&rsquo;s Universal Scalability Law, you may have heard it said that there are two coefficients, variously called alpha and beta or sigma and kappa. There are actually three coefficients, though. See?
\[ C(N) = \frac{N}{1 + \sigma(N-1) + \kappa N (N-1)} \]
No, you don&rsquo;t see it &ndash; but it&rsquo;s actually there, as a hidden 1 multiplied by N in the numerator on the right-hand side.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Mar 7, 2012</span>
        I presented at this year&rsquo;s [Hotsos Symposium](). I am searching for a claim to specialness, and I think it may be that I am the first Hotsos presenter who&rsquo;s specifically focused on MySQL. True? I don&rsquo;t know, but I&rsquo;ll run with it for now.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Oct 6, 2011</span>
        This post is a followup to some promises I made at Postgres Open.
Instrumentation can be a lot of work to add to a server, and it can add overhead to the server too. The bits of instrumentation I&rsquo;ll advocate in this post are few and trivial, but disproportionately powerful.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Jul 23, 2008</span>
        My editor Andy Oram recently sent me an ACM article on BASE, a technique for improving scalability by being willing to give up some other properties of traditional transactional systems.
It&rsquo;s a really good read. In many ways it is the same religion everyone who&rsquo;s successfully scaled a system Really Really Big has advocated. But this is different: it&rsquo;s a very clear article, with a great writing style that really cuts out the fat and teaches the principles without being specific to any environment or sounding egotistical.
