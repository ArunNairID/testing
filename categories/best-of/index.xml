          <description>&lt;p&gt;The way I think about product/market fit has changed a lot over the years. I
view it differently than I used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/12/whiskey-stones.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Whiskey Stones&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to think of product/market fit along the lines of: users are enthusiastic, word of mouth is positive, people are delighted, the app is a joy to use, it makes hard things easy, it nails the use case&amp;mdash;the app solves a problem or meets a need in such a way that it makes users happy. I&amp;rsquo;ve built the right thing to do the right thing in the right way. Obviously product/market fit, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. That&amp;rsquo;s service/user fit, not product/market fit. It&amp;rsquo;s not a bad thing, but it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; different. It took me a while to see that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s dig into what those three words (product, market, fit) mean. The following discussion is especially informed by my experience in business-to-business, but the general concepts are just as true in B2C or other types of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;product&#34;&gt;Product&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a product? A lot of people, especially engineers, especially past-me, think the product is the thing they build. I used to think of the product as the app, the service, the UI, the UX, the functionality. This couldn&amp;rsquo;t be further from the truth. The product isn&amp;rsquo;t what you &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt;. The product is what you &lt;em&gt;sell&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to confuse one for the other, but important to understand the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take whiskey stones as an example. Look at listings on Amazon and you&amp;rsquo;ll see sellers promoting the benefits of whiskey stones: chills your bourbon without diluting it with meltwater, no mess, reusable, convenient, etc. Sounds legit, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;rsquo;s the product, really? Is it the stones? No. To quote the famous line, people don&amp;rsquo;t buy quarter-inch drill bits, they buy quarter-inch holes. The product is the &lt;em&gt;result or outcome&lt;/em&gt;. Ostensibly chilled-but-not-ruined whiskey, but we&amp;rsquo;ll revisit that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I use a dating app as an example, the product isn&amp;rsquo;t the app, it&amp;rsquo;s companionship. If I use VividCortex, the product isn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vividcortex.com/&#34;&gt;database monitoring&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s improved revenue through a more responsive and efficient app or service. If the example is group chat, the product isn&amp;rsquo;t chat rooms, it&amp;rsquo;s a more connected and efficient workforce with less need for meetings. (Arguably.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;market&#34;&gt;Market&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I used to think of market very differently. I used to think the market was the user, but now I recognize that users don&amp;rsquo;t have to be the buyers. In Geoffrey Moore&amp;rsquo;s classic &lt;em&gt;Crossing the Chasm&lt;/em&gt;, he defines a market as &amp;ldquo;a set of actual or potential &lt;em&gt;customers&lt;/em&gt;, for a given set of products or services, who have a common set of needs or wants, and who reference each other when making a buying decision.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no fluff words in that definition. Importantly, the market is who you sell to. The market is the &lt;em&gt;buyer&lt;/em&gt;, not the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who is Facebook&amp;rsquo;s market? It isn&amp;rsquo;t the billions of users on their service. It&amp;rsquo;s the advertisers! If you&amp;rsquo;re selling a dating app, your users and buyers are the same. If you&amp;rsquo;re creating a free dating app that&amp;rsquo;s ad-supported, your users and market are not the same. When they&amp;rsquo;re the same, it&amp;rsquo;s just a coincidence. Many or perhaps even most products are sold to someone other than the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At VividCortex, for example, our users are developers, DBAs, technical operations teams, SREs, and the like. And, sure, these are our champions for promoting a sale internally, too. But we don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;sell&lt;/em&gt; to them, we sell to VPs and the C-suite and so on. In fact, we sell to &lt;em&gt;organizations&lt;/em&gt;, not individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear understanding of the market helps inform a clear understanding of the product. When you think about who &lt;em&gt;buys&lt;/em&gt; whiskey stones, the difference becomes obvious. If you talk to a whiskey drinker, or just read the reviews on Amazon, you hear something different than the product listing would like you to believe. &amp;ldquo;One star. My brother-in-law gave this to me. I know he meant well, but don&amp;rsquo;t give these as a gift. They&amp;rsquo;re just a hazard. They&amp;rsquo;ll smash your lips, break your teeth, and you&amp;rsquo;ll end up paying thousands of dollars for dental repairs. And they don&amp;rsquo;t chill well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who buys whiskey stones? Not whiskey drinkers. The actual market is their brothers-in-law. And that helps clarify what the product really is. The real product here, what the whiskey stone makers are selling, is a warm fuzzy feeling for people who think their brother-in-law is hard to buy for. The product listing, with its supposed benefits, is not designed to appeal to the drinkers, but to their relatives. And it literally plays to their ignorance about whiskey drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fit&#34;&gt;Fit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have product/market fit when you have clearly identified the &lt;em&gt;product&lt;/em&gt;, as just explained, and it &lt;em&gt;fits&lt;/em&gt; your &lt;em&gt;market&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; needs. Whiskey stone sellers have done a great job of selling warm fuzzies to in-laws; they have very good product/market fit. (What happens after the sale is a different matter.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really important part of fit &lt;em&gt;includes how your market buys&lt;/em&gt;. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t aligned your delivery mechanism with your market&amp;rsquo;s purchasing mechanisms, you don&amp;rsquo;t have product/market fit. For example, if you sell to the government, you probably have to go through approved channels and meet various types of regulatory approval. Otherwise nobody in the government can actually buy what you&amp;rsquo;re selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put this in terms of VividCortex again: we initially built a database monitoring service that made DBAs happy. Great! Nice service/user fit. Then we had to figure out how to sell it. Creating actual product/market fit required creating a sales team, enunciating our security stance, aligning our processes with the finance departments of our customers, and so on. This was &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more than just the app or service; that&amp;rsquo;s a small fraction of the whole product&amp;mdash;the tip of the proverbial iceberg. This is why I said &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/four-core-ip/&#34;&gt;sales is a key part of a company&amp;rsquo;s core IP&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, we&amp;rsquo;re selling the whole package&amp;mdash;our entire company&amp;mdash;to each buyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time we &amp;ldquo;closed&amp;rdquo; a deal with a big company. We had all the approvals, legal signoff, even a signature on the order form! The money was as good as in-the-bank. The next step was to talk to someone in the procurement department. No big deal, it sounded like we were just talking to finance in the usual way, figuring out who could issue the purchase order and giving them the bank wiring details. NO. This time it was different. They renegotiated the entire deal from scratch, put the hammer down on pricing, and killed the deal, refusing to let the company buy what dozens of people had worked hard to bring into their team for months. What the actual!?!?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was our first customer with a procurement department. As I was about to learn, big companies use these because there&amp;rsquo;s no chance all of their thousands of employees are going to negotiate good deals when they&amp;rsquo;re across the table from a salesperson with decades of experience. So companies put in gatekeepers &lt;em&gt;and give them commissions based on how much they&amp;rsquo;re able to browbeat vendors&lt;/em&gt;. These people can be absolute bulldogs (but usually in a very nice, apparently helpful but my-hands-are-tied way). The definition of their job is to get the vendor on their knees begging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the quarter and you&amp;rsquo;ve been using our service on hundreds of servers for 6 months already! Pleeeeease!!!&amp;rdquo;  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going on vacation, be back in a couple of weeks.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;ll handle our case in your absence?&amp;rdquo;  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;OUT OF OFFICE: RE: VividCortex Contract&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your worst nightmare. But you know what? &lt;em&gt;This is part of product/market fit.&lt;/em&gt; If you haven&amp;rsquo;t built your company to sell through your customers&amp;rsquo; purchasing processes, you don&amp;rsquo;t have product/market fit. Your market is your buyers, and procurement is ultimately the buyer in this example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revisiting Moore&amp;rsquo;s definition, it&amp;rsquo;s also helpful to remember that your market isn&amp;rsquo;t individual buyers. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a &lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt; of buyers, plural, with commonalities. This points out that one-off deals don&amp;rsquo;t constitute &amp;ldquo;fit.&amp;rdquo; Fit is achieved when your product, taken as a whole (i.e. not only what you sell, but how you deliver it to your market) fits your market as a whole. You&amp;rsquo;re not trying to create one-by-one fit, you&amp;rsquo;re trying to create something scalable and repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product/market fit is very different from what I thought when I founded VividCortex. I was really thinking about service/user fit without knowing it. Product/market fit isn&amp;rsquo;t when your users are getting value from your app. It&amp;rsquo;s when you sell the value you create, and your market&amp;mdash;a set of customers with common needs and who have herd buying behavior&amp;mdash;purchases and acquires it effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three words (product, market, fit) require clear understanding to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Meditation</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling more people about the benefits I&amp;rsquo;ve received from
meditation. Meditation has greatly influenced the way I think, behave, and
relate to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/03/ripples.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ripples&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t take up meditation for many years was that everyone had a
different definition of meditation. It seemed that in an effort to let people
discover something that worked for them without being overly prescriptive, all
the sources I turned to ended up saying nothing useful about meditation.
Apparently it could be literally anything or nothing. Some said it was thinking
about something, focusing on a mantra or an image; others said it was enjoying
the laughter of children; others a feeling of serenity and calm&amp;mdash;all completely
unhelpful to me. Everyone was talking about it, and the only thing I could
conclude was that none of them were actually doing it. The jargon around it, and
the glib catchphrases, turned me off even more. People seemed to rely on
meaningless phrases  as placeholders for real substance (&amp;ldquo;shine the heart
forward as you connect your breath to your intention and invite your om shanti
to blossom into full expression&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still other people seemed to have urban myth misconceptions, and warned me for
example that I might never &amp;ldquo;come back,&amp;rdquo; telling me about people they knew who&amp;rsquo;d
apparently turned into vegetables or become comatose. I suspect that either
these stories were false or had more to do with other activities, such as heavy
drug use. The idea that someone could short out their brain circuits does not
seem realistic to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation may have many outcomes, such as serenity and clarity, but the goal is
quite simple: to train yourself to observe your own mind and see
reality as it is. By doing this, you realize that you are not your thoughts. You
learn that you are not your &amp;ldquo;self,&amp;rdquo; which in fact is a false identity created by
the thinking part of the mind. You learn that you can &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; without &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;,
that the mind&amp;rsquo;s job is to think, but that mistakenly identifying this activity
as &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; is to miss that the mind and its thinking are ripples on the surface
of a deep, still, underlying existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &amp;ldquo;I think, therefore I am&amp;rdquo; mistake is like walking into a room with a
radio blaring and mistakenly believing that the radio is the room. If
you turn off the radio, the room still exists. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard some
sentences to the effect of &amp;ldquo;what is the sound of one hand clapping&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;if you
sit in silence, what you hear is the sound of the universe&amp;rdquo; and the like.
They&amp;rsquo;re trying to explain the undescribable, that which can only be explained by
pointing to what it&amp;rsquo;s not: the room is essentially silent, with radio noise
in it. Take away the noise and the silence is still there. Turn the radio
on again and the silence is still there, coexisting with the noise. Others
explain it by saying that the pool is still at the bottom even if there are
ripples on top, or that the sky is always blue above the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation helps you separate your existence from your thinking, which helps you
learn to sense and experience the silence, the blue sky, the stillness at the
bottom of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By training yourself to observe your mind, you become conscious of what it does.
Much of it is useful, but much isn&amp;rsquo;t. And if you are unconscious of these
thoughts, then your mind is in control of you, and not the other way around.
Developing the ability to witness your mind, and know it as something separate,
allows you to be unattached to the mind&amp;rsquo;s cravings, fears, doubts, conditioned
reactions, aversions, delusions, and other misery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s taken me half a dozen years to reach the point I have now. There were many
detours and many false prophets; many people teaching meditation without knowing
it themselves. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve found my way past those, everything is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll give two concrete examples of how meditation has changed me. Some months
ago I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/11/10/what-its-like/&#34;&gt;the agonizing pain and stress of being a
founder&lt;/a&gt;. The company was doing great,
investors were doubling down, customers were flocking to us, the team was
clicking into high gear, I had absolutely nothing to worry about, and yet I was
at the end of my rope. In fact, the better things got, the more exciting and
promising the future looked, the more stressed I was. My mind was getting the
bit between its teeth and running away, with me kicking and screaming along for
the ride. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation helped me realize that my problem was attaching my attention to
thoughts about the future. All of this good news about the company was tempting
me to think about what might happen, what looked likely to happen, what could
be. You who are practiced in meditation already know what I&amp;rsquo;m going to say. I
was taking my mind off the &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; and projecting it into a nonexistent future,
where good things might come to pass&amp;mdash;but then again they might not. For every
potentially good thing about which I could get excited, there was an equal and
opposite fear that it might not happen. In other words, the future is a mental
construct where the mind can project fear, doubt, and worry. It is a fabrication
that the mind creates to facilitate attaching itself and its sense of self-worth
to things that don&amp;rsquo;t even exist, so that it can freak out because they might
never exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example is related to this projection into the future.  The pain and
stress were doubly acute for me because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t used to thinking about the
future. Most of my life, just the opposite was true, and I avoided thoughts of
the future. I spent years in therapy trying to understand and recover from some
traumatic experiences I&amp;rsquo;d had. Every session my therapist would say, &amp;ldquo;Think back
to that time. Tell me about it.&amp;rdquo; The therapist was trying, in a Freudian way, to
help me do the same things as meditation does&amp;mdash;see my reactions to my thoughts
and memories, and disidentify from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation has helped me more in the space of a few months than therapy helped
in years. If I&amp;rsquo;d learned to meditate, I am pretty sure that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
have needed therapy. And I always felt vaguely sure, in a way I couldn&amp;rsquo;t
explain, that there had to be a more effective way of healing than repeatedly
talking about the horrible things that I&amp;rsquo;d experienced. Now I know what I was
groping for: a more direct and less abstract way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swinging from the past into the future, and experiencing it with a brutal shock,
then becoming aware that this was what was happening to me, taught me that life
must be lived&amp;mdash;indeed, &lt;em&gt;can only&lt;/em&gt; be lived&amp;mdash;in the present moment. The past no
longer exists. If I recall it, I&amp;rsquo;m recreating a memory of the past, and I&amp;rsquo;m
doing it in the now. If I think forward to the future, which likewise does not
exist, I&amp;rsquo;m doing the same thing and I&amp;rsquo;m doing it in the now. The past existed
once, but when it did, it was the now. The future, when it comes to be, will
come to be in the now. Now is the only moment that exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there is no multi-tasking. Attention given to one thing is taken from
another. Attention given to a memory is taken from the now that exists. In other
words, remembering the past or waiting for the future is actually opting not to
live at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meditate is to be in the now, to notice when thoughts arise, and to release
them rather than engaging them. Indulge me as I deploy another bad analogy: when
you&amp;rsquo;re caught up in thoughts, it&amp;rsquo;s as if you&amp;rsquo;re reading the mail; the
independent, outside observer is switched off and attention resides in the
thoughts themselves. When you&amp;rsquo;re observing the thoughts and releasing them, it&amp;rsquo;s
as if you&amp;rsquo;re simply handling or sorting the mail, shuffling it onwards without
opening the envelopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meditate is to see clearly the mind&amp;rsquo;s activity, the
thoughts, as separate.  It relies for its working on the impossibility of
multi-tasking. You can&amp;rsquo;t stop a thought; the harder you try, the more you&amp;rsquo;re
actually thinking about it. Instead, &lt;em&gt;experiencing&lt;/em&gt; the object of focus (usually
the breath) is a way of taking the focus from the thought and returning it to
the breath. In time, with practice, you realize that there is a &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; that
witnesses either the thought or the breath, and that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; is what you
might call Being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cannot be achieved by willing it; in fact, will is an exercise of the mind
and only binds you more tightly. You achieve it by relinquishing, releasing,
stepping back, surrendering, accepting, letting go of the will and experiencing
what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation is also &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what some people commonly say it is. It isn&amp;rsquo;t
relaxation or calm or inner peace (those are potential outcomes). It isn&amp;rsquo;t
thought control, the ability to stop thoughts. It isn&amp;rsquo;t a way to exercise the
mind to achieve greater intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;rsquo;t be explained (and I&amp;rsquo;m not doing it justice), it must be experienced. It
takes time. It takes practice.  It is a training exercise. The goal is to carry
present-moment awareness into every moment, to experience the present rather
than to be a couch potato in the room with the radio, absorbed in the
chatter, missing life as it exists in the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meditate is to train yourself to actually &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt;, to engage, to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this post reflects my current understanding. Those who are more
advanced than I will surely recognize my errors. To those who are less far along
the path, I hope it is helpful, and leads no one astray.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a new year and I drew a diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/01/feelings-and-behaviors.png&#34; alt=&#34;Feelings and Behaviors&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This diagram shows the spectra of what I can pay attention to and focus upon.
Along one axis, I can range between focusing on my feelings, or focusing on
other peoples&amp;rsquo; feelings. On the other, I can observe and learn from my actions
and their consequences, or I can notice what others do and what results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This diagram probably means something different to everyone
who reads it, but here&amp;rsquo;s what it means to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The healthiest people I know tend to care about &lt;strong&gt;what they do and how other
people feel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most troubled people I&amp;rsquo;ve known have focused on &lt;strong&gt;how they feel and what
other people do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other two quadrants are less pathological; more about them later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drew circles in the top-right and bottom-left because I believe there are
positions of dynamic equilibrium in these locations.  People who live top-right
don&amp;rsquo;t fix their attention unwaveringly on other/self; rather, they move fluidly
between external and internal observation and reasoning. This virtuous cycle is
a dynamic dance of loving, generous relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to live bottom-left, which is a vicious cycle, not a virtuous one. I saw
myself as a helpless victim, against whom the universe and world constantly
plotted.  I spent my time and energy noticing how I felt, ignoring my behaviors,
and blaming my feelings on what other people had &amp;ldquo;done to&amp;rdquo; me.  I modulated
these behaviors only enough to poke my head out of my hole and confirm my
suspicions that I was just a casualty of &amp;ldquo;the system&amp;rdquo; and the deck was all
stacked against me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other two quadrants don&amp;rsquo;t tend to be positions of equilibrium long-term.
Whether a person ends up top-right or bottom-left is a product of many different
possible circumstances, in my experience (N=1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more regions on this map than I&amp;rsquo;ve shown. For example, there are
people who live top-left in healthy ways. And most people aren&amp;rsquo;t possible to
represent as a point on the map. They occupy some area, usually rather fluidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m continually inspired by the people around me who live more in the top right
quadrant.  To the extent that I move upwards and rightwards this New Year, I
know I will be the better for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experience fewer moments of that old bottom-left behavior every New Year than
I did the year before. This is usually because of the choices I make&amp;ndash;much less
so than random events or other peoples&amp;rsquo; actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, I can choose where I direct my attention. This is tangible evidence
of what I really value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;At Velocity/OSCON 2015 in Amsterdam a couple of weeks ago, the conference
committee approached me to ask if I&amp;rsquo;d be up for doing an Ignite talk. It was
rather last-minute and I had only hours to prepare. I said yes and then tried to
think of a topic. I turned to Twitter and asked, if you could have me talk for 5
minutes on any topic, what would it be? A couple of people responded that they
wanted to know what founding a company was like, so I sat down in the speaker
lounge at the RAI and started trying to figure out what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be a
founder/CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;d think I&amp;rsquo;d know after three years, but truthfully, it&amp;rsquo;s still hard to
really know what I feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ignite&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I did it. I sent O&amp;rsquo;Reilly twenty slides of uncaptioned
&lt;a href=&#34;http://unsplash.com/&#34;&gt;images&lt;/a&gt; that moved through an arc, and tried to write a
story I could tell on stage. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Ignite, it&amp;rsquo;s a format
in which exactly twenty slides advance automatically after fifteen seconds each,
for a total of five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to wing it to some extent, and while speaking I thought one of the
slides might even have gotten lost in the void of the internet and I had to skip
some stuff I&amp;rsquo;d planned (it was really confusing to see what slide was on
screen), but I got through it. Below I&amp;rsquo;m sharing my notes&amp;mdash;which I did not
exactly follow, because I changed things until the moment I spoke&amp;mdash;and at the
end is a video of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a founder/CEO or similar, and you&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about your struggles,
I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to reach out to me or to peers. (I can&amp;rsquo;t be available for
everyone, but if you&amp;rsquo;re desperate you need to talk to someone.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The working title of the talk was either &amp;ldquo;What it&amp;rsquo;s like&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Why I do this&amp;rdquo; or
something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, enough preamble, let&amp;rsquo;s do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-i-choose-technology&#34;&gt;Why I Choose Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00001.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago my friend Eliane asked why I love databases, and it took me years to
answer. I always loved knowing how things work. I used to disassemble clocks and
put them back together. Eventually I realized that technology is how I express
my creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;creative-expression&#34;&gt;Creative Expression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00002.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00002.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creativity is a vital part of being human. All forms of expression are equally
valid: dance, music, art, writing, athletics, coding. Whatever you love,
whatever brings you alive, is valid. That includes being a nerd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-importance-of-creativity&#34;&gt;The Importance of Creativity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00003.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00003.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creativity is self actualization. It&amp;rsquo;s how we express agency in the world. It&amp;rsquo;s
how we say &amp;ldquo;I am alive and I choose to live, not just exist.&amp;rdquo; I want this for
you, and for me, all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-i-founded-a-company&#34;&gt;So I Founded A Company&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00004.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00004.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years ago I founded company to amplify my personal mission, to give to
others what I wanted for myself: a life of purpose and validation that being a
nerd is just as honorable as being a sculptor. I speak today because I want to
share this experience with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-s-it-like-being-a-founder&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s It Like Being A Founder?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00005.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00005.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a word, stressful. Words to describe it don&amp;rsquo;t really exist. It&amp;rsquo;s a roller
coaster from fear to joy and back, sometimes every 20 minutes. I can describe
specific dimensions of the experience, but it&amp;rsquo;s like becoming a parent. You have
to live it to know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;demands-from-everywhere&#34;&gt;Demands From Everywhere&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00006.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00006.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants something from me. Customers, employees, investors, community,
family, vendors, governments. The amount of time and energy left over for myself
is very small. Personal and company demands are often in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-comfort-zone&#34;&gt;No Comfort Zone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00007.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00007.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My comfort zone is mostly off-limits now. I am a reserved person, but I must be
outgoing. I prefer to support people, now I must sometimes challenge them. I&amp;rsquo;m a
single-tasking focuser, now I have to multitask. I deny myself the pleasure of a
job well done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;compounding-effects&#34;&gt;Compounding Effects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00008.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00008.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to find time or motivation for exercise. I constantly forget things
and people. This becomes a self-reinforcing negative spiral quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sleep-is-elusive&#34;&gt;Sleep Is Elusive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00009.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00009.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wake and cannot deal with intrusive thoughts and a racing pulse. At
2 in the morning, jacked on adrenaline and fear, I&amp;rsquo;m not solving anything. When
I do sleep I have repetitive dreams of being late and unprepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-struggle&#34;&gt;The Struggle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00010.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00010.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ben Horowitz&amp;rsquo;s book The Hard Thing About Hard Things is the best description
of the experience I&amp;rsquo;ve read yet. to get a taste, read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bhorowitz.com/the_struggle&#34;&gt;The
Struggle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;self-reconstruction&#34;&gt;Self-Reconstruction&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00011.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00011.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a founder and CEO forces me to constantly destroy the old person I used
to be. He is no longer what I need. He got me to this point, but now the task
is to systematically amputate the parts I do not want and grow new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;overwhelm&#34;&gt;Overwhelm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00012.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00012.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is way beyond &amp;ldquo;productivity tips&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;life hacking.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s self
transformation. This is what it means to be committed. The only way through it
is through it. It&amp;rsquo;s often a brutal process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-much-to-lose&#34;&gt;So Much To Lose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00013.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00013.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to ask for help because there&amp;rsquo;s so much to lose. Everyone is looking
for the slightest sign of weakness or fault. Honestly admitting a shortcoming
could mean not winning a customer or investor, losing an employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;loneliness&#34;&gt;Loneliness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00014.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00014.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not alone in the struggle, but I&amp;rsquo;m lonely. Most founders suffer in silence
and isolation. Depression, sickness, addiction, breakdowns and even suicide
are the result. It&amp;rsquo;s rare for founders to break the silence. I&amp;rsquo;m doing it
today because we deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-impostor-syndrome&#34;&gt;Not Impostor Syndrome&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00015.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00015.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s popular right now to talk about impostor syndrome, but this isn&amp;rsquo;t impostor
syndrome. This is real and honest. This is a valid experience. I take comfort
knowing that my discomfort with this unnatural experience is an appropriate
response to the position I&amp;rsquo;m in. If you are feeling the same thing, know that
you&amp;rsquo;re not damaged goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;daily-rededication&#34;&gt;Daily Rededication&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00016.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00016.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cope and adapt, I have to make an effort to help myself and ask others to
help me. I begin each day by dedicating myself to the service of something
greater than myself. I resolve to be fully alive, present in the moment, and
to suppress my self-will. I read sacred literature. I journal. Then I go do my
best. I end the day by forgiving myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;meditation&#34;&gt;Meditation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00017.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00017.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation is a huge part of what keeps me sane. Meditation does not still my
mind or stop the intrusive thoughts. It helps me notice and accept what is
happening to me, within me, and around me. I worked with an architect, an old
man with a lifelong transcendental meditation practice, for years. But I lost
it. I had to find a system that actually worked for me. The Headspace book and
app helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;asking-for-help&#34;&gt;Asking For Help&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00018.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00018.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also ask for help. I&amp;rsquo;ve reached out to a lot of other founders and talked.
They may not know it but they&amp;rsquo;ve made a huge difference for me. I hope you
reach out to me if you need help, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;working-as-a-team&#34;&gt;Working as a Team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00019.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00019.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also had to learn to stop trying to do everything myself. I have a team
of people who are better at their jobs than I am. I don&amp;rsquo;t ask them to be my
confidantes, but they support me whether they know it or not. And I have
advisors, mentors, and a professional coach who make it easier day by day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate-conclusion-1-you-make-a-difference&#34;&gt;Alternate Conclusion 1: You Make A Difference&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00020.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00020.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds hard. Why do I do it? I do it because of you. You are here for a
purpose. You have impact. The world needs you and cannot replace you. You make
a difference. But really, I do it for you because doing it for you is doing it
for myself. I must be to the world what I want the world to be for me. I get
back more than I give. My lows are lower, but my highs are higher too. Thank
you. &lt;em&gt;[I wanted to end with a note of inspiration and encouragement, gesturing
towards each person&amp;rsquo;s irreplaceable role in life, but I changed this ending at
the last moment.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate-conclusion-2-why-do-i-do-it&#34;&gt;Alternate Conclusion 2: Why Do I Do It?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00020.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00020.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the product, company, and the team serve a greater good. It&amp;rsquo;s
true that it&amp;rsquo;s hard, but I believe I must be what I want to see in the world.
My low times are worse, but my highs are higher. &lt;em&gt;[I chose this ending because I
thought the note of encouragement, although important and true, was not
consistent with the rest of the talk. The sentiment of the first alternative
ending still holds, though.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Personality Assessments</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/10/11/personality-assessments/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2015 11:26:16 -0400</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/10/11/personality-assessments/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of years I have increasingly studied and used personality tests for personal and professional uses, both for myself and for others. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a variety of benefits, but these assessments are not without drawbacks, and not all assessments are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/10/different.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;different&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personality assessments, at their finest, are statistical tools created and validated by teams of psychologists and mathematicians. At their worst, they are snake oil, invented and promoted by people with no real expertise, and claimed to achieve results that stretch credibility, sometimes even though they&amp;rsquo;ve been repeatedly shown not to work. There are many shades of gray in between: tests that work okay but are difficult to interpret, tests that show results that aren&amp;rsquo;t really actionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-assessments-good-for&#34;&gt;What Are Assessments Good For?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found that the better-designed assessments can be helpful for understanding a variety of aspects of myself and others. I always use myself as the first test subject. Part of my personality (which the best tests confirm!) is a desire to improve myself through observation and understanding, so I can see my strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the insights to help me understand how I can do things such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand where and when I&amp;rsquo;m likely to behave well or badly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predict how a person will respond to interactions and adjust my approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate effectively, using a person&amp;rsquo;s natural style instead of my own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Match a person&amp;rsquo;s strengths to a situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask better questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also use assessments, individually and with teams, to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help people understand themselves and their desired career paths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform pairwise comparisons between people and help coach them through the results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help groups understand how they&amp;rsquo;re similar or different (e.g. sales vs marketing vs engineering) and how to accommodate those differences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine what behaviors, motivations, and skills are required for a role, and in which areas a candidate is a good match for that (job and gap reports).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-kinds-of-assessments-are-there&#34;&gt;What Kinds Of Assessments Are There?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, many assessments try to examine a person from a few viewpoints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behaviors. These are externally observable tendencies. Generally they focus on a person&amp;rsquo;s preferred style of behavior, sometimes under a variety of situations such as stress. Behaviors often include the style of interaction with others as well as alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivators. These &amp;ldquo;values&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;driving forces&amp;rdquo; are internal preferences or situational factors that can help explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; a person behaves as they do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competencies. Tests of competency try to evaluate how well a person achieves specific types of tasks. Some tests try to evaluate &amp;ldquo;raw intelligence,&amp;rdquo; while others evaluate specific skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldview. These assessments rate a person&amp;rsquo;s attitudes and opinions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differences. Some assessments don&amp;rsquo;t try to judge what a person is good/bad or high/low at, but where they&amp;rsquo;re unusually different from other people; in other words, what makes them most uniquely themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found the behaviors and motivators far easier to understand than many of the other types of assessment results. I work with a professional management coach and I&amp;rsquo;m still studying and trying to learn to interpret some of the worldview assessments, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-assessments-valid-and-useful&#34;&gt;Are Assessments Valid And Useful?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of controversy over these assessments and their use in hiring or other professional situations. You can do a quick web search and immediately find more information than you need about the usefulness and validity of the assessments. For example, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cio.com/article/2861657/it-skills/are-personality-assessments-effective-hiring-tools.html&#34;&gt;CIO article&lt;/a&gt; concludes that personality assessments need to be used carefully but can be valuable, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/27/study-delivers-bleak-verdict-on-validity-of-psychology-experiment-results&#34;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; reports that psychology studies across the board don&amp;rsquo;t stand up well to rigorous science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After using them for a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the opinion that there really are good assessments, but the bad assessments give all of them a bad reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even the best assessments are imperfect. They&amp;rsquo;re based on statistically likely observations about large populations of people, and in my experience are often pretty accurate predictors, but not always. I&amp;rsquo;ve known a couple of people for whom specific results were quite wrong. Part of this comes down to how the person takes the assessment, and some kinds of personalities are actually harder to analyze than others. In other words, some people are naturally going to give answers that result in highly accurate outcomes, and some people will micro-analyze and defeat the test while they take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/10/mac-desktop.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mac&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to be careful when using the assessments in hiring, in particular. If you base a hiring decision on an assessment that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been subjected to adverse impact analysis, you could open yourself to claims of discrimination. I use the results to help me have a better conversation with the candidate, not to make a hire/reject decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the tests are just fluff. They&amp;rsquo;re like horoscopes, designed to sound meaningful for everyone. In fact, there have even been experiments on how much people believe personality assessments. (People believe the tests are accurate, even when the results are copy-pasted from an astrology book and everyone got the same answers. This is known as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect&#34;&gt;Barnum effect&lt;/a&gt;. You can take this &lt;a href=&#34;http://forer.netopti.net/&#34;&gt;bogus assessment&lt;/a&gt; yourself; after doing so, see how good you think the results are. This is a good trick to play on your friends.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, you can usually tell the smoke-and-mirrors tests by looking at how polished and slick the reports are. The better tests are usually more concerned with information than appearances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, my personal belief is that the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which is the most popular and well-known by far, is not very revealing. After you&amp;rsquo;ve studied other assessments for a while, the MBTI looks weak in comparison. I&amp;rsquo;ll let you study this on your own if you&amp;rsquo;re interested. For a little light reading you might be interested in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/03/29/for-holy-week-heres-how-you-can-match-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-to-a-patron-saint/&#34;&gt;how the MBTI types match up to patron saints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The better-quality assessments are based on well-known models of human psychology that were invented/discovered by researchers and have subsequently been commercialized, often by many companies. The Big Five and the DISC model are examples. There are many implementations of these models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When researching personality assessments online, I would caution you to take what you find with lots of skepticism. Predicting whether a person is a good fit for a job is an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; interesting outcome for companies, because hiring the best people and avoiding bad hires is often the difference between success and failure as a business. As a result, the companies that develop and administer the tests are making &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; good profits, and sometimes go to extremes to ensure that the information available online makes them look good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Wikipedia is not immune to this effect. Many articles about the assessments are full of weasel words and blatant advertising, and few people in the general public have the knowledge or motivation to properly moderate the articles, so you end up with claims like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The [redacted] has been considered the &amp;ldquo;gold standard&amp;rdquo; in personality testing&lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, my personal view is that any test that is offered &lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt; by a single company is suspect. I give more credence to models that were developed by researchers and then implemented by companies. I am also skeptical of companies that make sweeping claims such as &lt;em&gt;The XYZ assessments are ideal for a wide range of applications&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; In my opinion, no assessment is &amp;ldquo;ideal&amp;rdquo; for anything, much less a &amp;ldquo;wide range&amp;rdquo; of things. Unfortunately, even the tests that I believe are good use verbiage like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A word of caution: just because the questions you have to answer during the assessment seem vague or contradictory doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it is fluff. Many of the personality tests are designed to force you to compare and rank things that aren&amp;rsquo;t directly comparable. By doing this in a variety of dimensions, they are able to use factor analysis to get multi-dimensional results. This is a legitimate statistical technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;available-assessments&#34;&gt;Available Assessments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a stunning range of assessments available, ranging from amateur to academic to professional. For personal interest, they might all be fun to use, but for professional purposes I&amp;rsquo;d stick with ones that have invested in large-scale, longitudinal studies of effectiveness and adverse impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessments and companies that are widely used in business, from what I observed through discussions with various managers and recruiting specialists, are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ttisuccessinsights.com/&#34;&gt;TTI Success Insights&lt;/a&gt;, which is the company my coach and I use; it&amp;rsquo;s also what many companies such as the Rainmaker Group resell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.calipercorp.com/&#34;&gt;Caliper Hiring Assessments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.criteriacorp.com/solution/SalesAP.php&#34;&gt;Criteria Employment Tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the companies mentioned provide a range of assessments such as DISC and Big Five. Many of them also provide a free assessment, so if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in taking one for yourself, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay a lot of money for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some other resources online, each offering one or multiple tests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://personality-testing.info/&#34;&gt;personality-testing.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/&#34;&gt;The Big Five&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.keirsey.com/&#34;&gt;The Kiersey Sorter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.123test.com/&#34;&gt;A variety of free psych tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tonyrobbins.com/disc-profile/&#34;&gt;Tony Robbins&amp;rsquo;s test website&lt;/a&gt; provides InnerMetrix DISC and Values tests for free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some &lt;a href=&#34;http://ipip.ori.org/&#34;&gt;collaborations amongst scientists for free and open study&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/5/j5j/IPIP/&#34;&gt;free online version of the NEO PI-R test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, there&amp;rsquo;s more. Here are some other tests I&amp;rsquo;ve seen but haven&amp;rsquo;t examined much:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FIRO-B. I didn&amp;rsquo;t take a much deeper look because after examining one person&amp;rsquo;s report I concluded it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very useful. It&amp;rsquo;s also administered and sold by CPP, the company that promotes MBTI. I distrust it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Interpersonal Style Inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-disc-model&#34;&gt;The DISC Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most widely commercialized personality models is the DISC model. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the ones I use, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably one of the best to get started with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISC is an acronym for four dimensions of a person&amp;rsquo;s behavioral style&amp;mdash;things that are externally observable. Each dimension can rank from very low to very high. There&amp;rsquo;s a fair amount of interplay amongst the dimensions, and various combinations of them tend to indicate different things. In my own words, here&amp;rsquo;s a gross oversimplification:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The D stands for Dominance, sometimes called Directness. It relates to how you respond to challenges in your external environment: do you attack them forcefully and aggressively (high-D) or do you avoid or try to solve them indirectly? A person who&amp;rsquo;s high D gets right to the point and pushes themselves and others, and also in my experience tends to become very Defensive when challenged or coached.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The I stands for Influence, or Interactivity, and relates to how much you try to persuade others. A high-I person can win people to their point of view, typically by promoting its benefits. They are also similarly attracted to nice things themselves, and can sometimes be distracted by &amp;ldquo;shiny objects&amp;rdquo; or aesthetically pleasing things or experiences. A high-I person also tends to need lots of social interaction and may like being praised, especially in public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The S stands for Steadiness or Stability, and relates to preferred working style. A high-S person is patient and a focused single-tasker; a low-S person is a plate-spinning multi-tasker who&amp;rsquo;s easily distracted and likes instant gratification. High-S people also get stressed when placed in multi-tasking situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The C stands for Compliance or Caution. High-C people care a lot about the world&amp;rsquo;s rules, standards, and procedures, and they want to make sure they&amp;rsquo;re following the rules because they believe that provides safety. Low-C people think rules are for controlling other people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people are high in two dimensions and low in the other two. It&amp;rsquo;s a little less common, but people can be moderately high in a few, and I&amp;rsquo;ve even seen a few people who were high in three categories. Programmers, for example, tend to be high-S, high-C. Many salespeople are high-I and either high-D or high-S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find many places to take the DISC test, such as TTI Success Insights&amp;rsquo;s website, Tony Robbins&amp;rsquo;s website, and some of the free testing sites I linked above. I have taken lots of those tests and gotten almost exactly the same results from all of them, no matter which provider I used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also asked about 20 of my friends to take some of these tests and share the results with me so I could practice studying and understanding people&amp;rsquo;s personalities. I feel this has helped me be more observant and a better judge of character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TTI Success Insights and Tony Robbins&amp;rsquo;s test website both provide free DISC and Values tests. The benefit of adding the Values test is that the assessment tries to help you understand potential strengths and conflicts between the ways you like to behave, and the things that motivate you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Five tests are similar to DISC in some ways, but I don&amp;rsquo;t find it as easy to apply or understand. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say it is inaccurate, but it feels incomplete to me, as though some of the things it measures are secondary rather than primary, and there are some primary things missing (e.g. how aggressive someone is). This may be a function of how familiar I am with DISC, rather than an objective judgment of the models. To be fair, DISC doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem fully faithful in my experience either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivators-models&#34;&gt;Motivators Models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Values are the things a person cares about&amp;mdash;what motivates them. Unlike behaviors, which seem to be pretty steady for a lot of people over the long term, values are sometimes situationally driven and can change, especially with major life events such as getting married, having children, moving, or changing jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TTI&amp;rsquo;s motivators are theoretical, utilitarian, aesthetic, social, individualistic, and traditional. The InnerMetrix motivators (values) are aesthetic, economic, individualistic, political, altruistic, regulatory, and theoretical. Although they use similar names, I think the meanings are a bit different in some nuances. I don&amp;rsquo;t prefer one of these to the other, but I&amp;rsquo;m more familiar with the TTI assessments because I&amp;rsquo;ve used them a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: TTI&amp;rsquo;s new Driving Forces assessment is based off the motivators
assessment but is more nuanced and some of the items are renamed to reflect
that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example, using the TTI Driving Forces assessment. One of the
dimensions, Utilitarianism, varies between Selflessness and Resourcefulness.
Selfless - People who are driven by completing tasks for the greater good, with
little expectation of personal return.
Resourceful - People who are driven by practical results, maximizing both
efficiency and returns for their investments of time, talent, energy and
resources. In other words, resourceful people do things
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/intent/&#34;&gt;intentionally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dimension is what motivates how you behave towards others. Now called
Others, previously called Social, it ranges from
Altruistic (People who are driven to assist others for the satisfaction of
being helpful or supportive) to
Intentional (People who are driven to assist others for a specific purpose, not just for the sake of being helpful or supportive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these dimensions relate to the expected outcome of a decision or
activity: do you do it for the greater good, or to achieve a goal? I&amp;rsquo;ve found
this to be extremely revealing about people. It&amp;rsquo;s not to say one is good or bad;
all of these dimensions are good for different things. Picture an EMT versus a
hospice care nurse, or the way a real estate developer feels about a plot of
land versus how a biologist or forest service worker does. You can probably
predict which types of people are best suited for those jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matching people to jobs they&amp;rsquo;re naturally motivated to do results in
effortless, joyful work that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like work and never gets stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: After a few years using the TTI values assessment, now called Driving Forces, I have grown more and more impressed with it. Watching people react to their assessments hundreds of times, along with observing them in interview settings of 60-90 minutes or even longer, I have come to see it as extremely accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;strengths-assessments&#34;&gt;Strengths Assessments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an open topic of debate whether one should try to work with their strengths and ignore their weaknesses, or try to improve their weak points. Some, such as Drucker in his classic &lt;em&gt;Managing Oneself&lt;/em&gt;, argue that you should find your strengths and use them, because your weaknesses are often hard to improve. I believe that being aware of my weaknesses has helped me to improve some of the &amp;ldquo;low hanging fruit&amp;rdquo; over time, and some weak points are pretty easy to improve dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two projects that try to help people understand their strengths and weaknesses, and particularly their &lt;em&gt;most unique&lt;/em&gt; strengths and weaknesses, are the &lt;a href=&#34;http://strengths.gallup.com/&#34;&gt;StrengthsFinder 2.0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://standout.tmbc.com&#34;&gt;StandOut&lt;/a&gt; assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these have companion books. If you buy the book, you get a code that lets you take the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone recommended the StrengthsFinder book to me. To tell the truth I found it difficult to understand the results. There are way too many dimensions to the report and I don&amp;rsquo;t think all of them are clearly distinguished from each other, and the names and descriptions of them seem to be extremely general as well. Besides, they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to mean what they say; it&amp;rsquo;s as though the terms are redefined instead of using the accepted meanings of the words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did find the StandOut report to be more straightforward, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have found it interesting or highly useful on an ongoing basis. I seem to continue to return to the DISC and Values results for further study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also feel that the DISC and Values results are more well-developed and have benefited from being applied to many more people. For example, they&amp;rsquo;ve been used widely enough that they&amp;rsquo;re evaluated in context of a culture (the report takes into account whether you&amp;rsquo;re a Spanish-speaking American, for example). I think that provides a greater specificity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not use these assessments in hiring. I use TTI&amp;rsquo;s more advanced reports (competencies and worldviews), which are only available in the paid reports. But for low-cost reports I think StandOut is a reasonable one you can use on a personal basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-bhagavad-gita&#34;&gt;The Bhagavad-Gita&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now for something completely different!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personality profiling and categorization isn&amp;rsquo;t new. The Bhagavad-Gita&amp;rsquo;s last
third contains extensive discussion of the different types of people. It
separates them into three major categories, each influenced by a
&lt;em&gt;guna&lt;/em&gt; (strand or quality).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t take this seriously, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think the last third of this great text
is the most worthy of deep study. But it&amp;rsquo;s still fun and interesting in some
ways to think about how the author of the Gita categorizes people, their modes
of worship, their types of action, the kinds of foods they eat, and so on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the light of knowledge shines forth&lt;br&gt;
through all the gates of the body,&lt;br&gt;
then it is apparent&lt;br&gt;
that &lt;em&gt;sattva&lt;/em&gt; is the ruling trait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greed and constant activity,&lt;br&gt;
excessive projects, cravings,&lt;br&gt;
restlessness: these arise&lt;br&gt;
when &lt;em&gt;rajas&lt;/em&gt; is the ruling trait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darkness, dullness, stagnation,&lt;br&gt;
indolence, confusion, torpor,&lt;br&gt;
inertia: these appear&lt;br&gt;
when &lt;em&gt;tamas&lt;/em&gt; is the ruling trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This excerpt is from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Bhagavad-Gita-Translation-Stephen-Mitchell/dp/0609810340/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;Stephen Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s wonderful new translation of the
Bhagavad-Gita&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that the better-quality personality assessments are meaningful and useful, though not perfect. In my opinion they&amp;rsquo;re good tools for personal and professional development of oneself and others, as well as improving interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the TTI assessments professionally. I know people who use Caliper, Chally, and Criterion among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For personal use I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to suggest getting the free assessments from any of these, as well as the InnerMetrix ones from Tony Robbins&amp;rsquo;s website (which may also be available for free elsewhere too, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For professional use I would suggest working with an experienced management coach. These companies often have networks of certified professionals who are trained in administering and interpreting their assessments, as well as using them in an ongoing process of improvement. My coach is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eureconsulting.com/&#34;&gt;Brad Eure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote in quite a bit of detail about the use of personality assessments in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vividcortex.com/resources/building-scalable-dba-team/&#34;&gt;VividCortex&amp;rsquo;s ebook on building and managing a team of database administrators&lt;/a&gt;. That ebook contains actual data from volunteers who took the assessments. It may be interesting further reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;After a lot of further experience with personality tests in the
teams I manage, as well as taking many more tests myself, I am fully convinced
that the TTI Success Insights evaluations, especially the full battery of four
models, is the best on the market. These assessments use models that match human
behavior, values, etc very well. They are also extremely accurate. They resist
&amp;ldquo;gaming&amp;rdquo; and other types of manipulation. The more I use them the more impressed
I am. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2016/03/27/personality-assessment-values-profile/&#34;&gt;this blog
post&lt;/a&gt; for more on some
of the additional assessments beyond DISC and Values/Driving Forces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/3/30/how-we-scale-vividcortexs-backend-systems.html&#34;&gt;a guest post for High
Scalability&lt;/a&gt;
about how we scale our backend systems at VividCortex. It&amp;rsquo;s heavy on MySQL,
sprinkled with a little bit of Redis&amp;rsquo;s magic pixie dust, and Kafka is also a key
part of the architecture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/03/fern.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;fern&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our workload is unusual in that some use cases require reading huge amounts of
data with interactive response times. We have lots of time-series data, but
not a typical time-series workload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our data distribution is also weird.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read optimization is vital, but we are extremely write-heavy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re sharded &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; partitioned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We run our systems on just a few low-end EC2 machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go is a huge part of our speed to market and cost efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We use a &amp;ldquo;just enough micro-&amp;rdquo; services-oriented architecture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our success with MySQL is probably not easy to duplicate with, say, Cassandra.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Really careful data layout and creativity is key to optimization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;InnoDB&amp;rsquo;s clustered indexes are vitally important.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We could probably improve upon this system by 2-4 orders of magnitude, but
there would be cost and effort involved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that sounds interesting, &lt;a href=&#34;http://highscalability.com/blog/2015/3/30/how-we-scale-vividcortexs-backend-systems.html&#34;&gt;read the full
post&lt;/a&gt; for a lot more detail. It&amp;rsquo;s about a 30 minute read.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why DevOps needs a manifesto after all, but may never get one.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/02/rplusl_brain.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;brain&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article originally appeared on &lt;a href=&#34;http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/the-devops-identity-crisis.html&#34;&gt;O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Radar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DevOps is everywhere! The growth and mindshare of the movement is remarkable. But if you care deeply about DevOps, you might agree with me when I say that although its moment has “arrived,” DevOps is in serious trouble. The movement is fragmented and weakly defined, and is being usurped by those who care more about short-term opportunities than the long-term viability of DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;they-are-the-ninety-nine-percent-and-nobody-cares&#34;&gt;They are the ninety-nine percent, and nobody cares&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How bad could it be? Travel back in time. It is mid-November 2011, and Occupy Wall Street is occupying the headlines. One of the major reasons is that the protestors are targeting shipping ports on the West Coast, causing shutdowns and even violence. As things are getting out of hand, parts of the movement start condemning these actions as counter-productive, hurting the 99% instead of the intended 1%. Spokespeople for the movement are quoted in the media as saying the instigators “don’t represent the movement.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did the Occupy movement become a footnote in history so fast? There were several reasons: there was no cohesive agreement on its identity, values, goals, and mission; in an effort to be unlike “them,” the OWS proponents avoided anything that looked like centralized leadership; and it seemed to be entirely negative, advocating nothing to replace what it wanted to remove.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe a similar thing is happening to DevOps right now, for many of the same reasons. Let’s talk about some of these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;messaging-and-positioning&#34;&gt;Messaging and positioning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Messaging and positioning are vital when you’re trying to promote something, because without them, nobody will understand what you’re doing, why, and why they should care. DevOps has a messaging and positioning problem, and it hurts the movement. Positioning a product or service can be done several ways, but a standard one that’s worked well for me on several occasions is filling in the blanks of the following template:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For&lt;/strong&gt; (target customer)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Who&lt;/strong&gt; (statement of need or opportunity)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The&lt;/strong&gt; (product) is a (product category)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;That&lt;/strong&gt; (statement of benefit or compelling reason to buy)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Unlike&lt;/strong&gt; (primary competitive alternative)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;It is&lt;/strong&gt; (statement of differentiation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a statement of facts, it’s a statement of how you want a target audience to perceive you. You can probably fill in the template quickly for any number of products, trends, and audiences: the iPad, texting, Breaking Bad, Spotify. Now try replacing the parenthesized phrases for DevOps. If you are like me, you’ll find it difficult, especially when you get to the last line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pullquote-full&#34;&gt;DevOps can be forgotten as quickly as it arose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-s-unique-about-devops&#34;&gt;What’s unique about DevOps?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last line of the positioning statement is about differentiation, and it’s foundational. Messaging and positioning isn’t enough. You also need something unique and compelling to message and position — something others can’t say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does DevOps offer that’s unique? This is likely to be a real struggle, no matter what you think of DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Breaking down silos? Read some of Patrick Lencioni’s books.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuous learning, creating learning organizations? Pick up a copy of Peter Senge’s &lt;em&gt;The Fifth Discipline&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aligning IT with business objectives? This is covered by a lot of management gurus, like Peter Drucker.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing variability in processes? Read &lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt;, or learn about Six Sigma.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on and on it goes. This is a vitally important question: is DevOps just old wine in a new skin? What, exactly, does it advance over previous practices? I am unable to find anything in anyone’s definition of DevOps that isn’t a restatement of an established idea or practice. I think this is a serious challenge. It means that DevOps can be forgotten as quickly as it arose — perhaps replaced by another movement that’s similar but has stronger messaging, positioning, and unique value propositions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-echo-chambers&#34;&gt;The echo chambers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a movement that talks about breaking down silos, DevOps can be pretty cliquey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re selling a “DevOps tool,” for example, there’s a passionate community of people who object that DevOps isn’t tools, isn’t purchasable, isn’t something you can take off the shelf and unwrap. Of course, there are companies who are looking for just that, others who are selling it to them, and the results are quite good by some accounts. But sometimes people seem unwilling to listen to DevOps success stories when they disagree with how DevOps is presented in the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, those who say that enterprises need to do DevOps differently from smaller organizations might be trying to sell an exclusive “enterprise” flavor of DevOps. This is an old trick for management consultants — brand your process/framework/methodology. Boy, does this get some hackles up fast! But why should it? It’s just using messaging and positioning to create a unique value proposition, or the perception of one — something the objectors have not succeeded in doing themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, those who care most are often those with the most at stake. For example, if DevOps is defined as “developers understanding and caring about the impact of their code in production,” it isn’t surprising that the people who are responsible for production systems are happy with the outcome, and sometimes the developers are not as interested. It makes a difference for the sysadmin’s life, but not necessarily for the developer’s. When a sysadmin rails against a developer’s “wrong” ideas about DevOps, therefore, it can be a turn-off. Likewise, a very senior person with lots of experience in formal practices can get irritated when they’re criticized by a younger person who’s never even heard of those disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My experience is that this all adds up to create echo chambers — groups of people who insist on particular meanings for DevOps, and get strident when others hold different views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand why people fear the reversal of a cultural shift that’s benefited them. But I think it’s important to understand that the rise of factions was predictable and unavoidable, due to the lack of definition and agreement about what that change was in the first place, and why it was a good thing. This might be a good thing, because it might show how to solve these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;where-to-go-from-here&#34;&gt;Where to go from here&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully I’ve convinced you there’s a problem. Nobody agrees on what DevOps means — except within its echo chambers. The name is vague. The tenets are unoriginal. There’s no cohesive leadership or central personality who can address these problems, so it’s a free-for-all, with companies and individuals using it in obviously self-serving ways. That’s why I say DevOps has an identity crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d suggest that, as contrary to DevOps as this might sound, we really need messaging and positioning that we can stand behind. And then we need to be public about it. As one of the characters in the popular DevOps book The Phoenix Project said, “messiahs are good, but scripture is better.” This means that some people need to assert themselves: “We are the ones who created DevOps, our definition is authoritative, and we’ve signed our names to the manifesto. If you want it to be something else, call it by a different name.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem, though, is that DevOps’s only manifesto is “no manifestos.” But nature abhors a vacuum, and without a manifesto, everyone’s going to supply their own. This is clearly what has happened: the Four Pillars, the Three Ways, and so on. There are literally dozens of definitions of DevOps, depending on whom you ask. In The Phoenix Project, there are even references to The DevOps Cookbook, a definition in the form of a book that doesn’t exist!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;pullquote-full&#34;&gt;What can it hurt to create at least a simple website that we all agree represents the core of the DevOps philosophy?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it time to rethink the “no manifestos” mandate? What can it hurt to create at least a simple website that we all agree represents the core of the DevOps philosophy? Something worthy of being the first reference from the Wikipedia article, in place of the hodgepodge of bits and pieces referenced there today? You have to start somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my part, although I have expressed some concerns and reservations here, I enjoy the conversations and company of people who are interested in DevOps of many flavors. I try to adhere to the philosophy of “take what you like and leave the rest.” This works for me, but I do wish for a more tangible wheel to which I can put my shoulder. I hope that this article is a step toward that in some way, and I look forward to many more conversations online, in-person, and at events such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.devopsdays.org/&#34;&gt;DevOpsDays&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://velocityconf.com/&#34;&gt;Velocity&lt;/a&gt;, and O’Reilly’s upcoming &lt;a href=&#34;http://softwarearchitecturecon.com/sa2015&#34;&gt;Software Architecture Conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to various people at O’Reilly, Dave Zwieback, Nathen Harvey, Bridget Kromhout, Mandi Walls, and Anna Navatsyk for helping with this article directly, and numerous others for helping indirectly.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>If Eventual Consistency Seems Hard, Wait Till You Try MVCC</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/12/08/eventual-consistency-simpler-than-mvcc/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 08 Dec 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/12/08/eventual-consistency-simpler-than-mvcc/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;This should sound familiar:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the great lies about NoSQL databases is that they&amp;rsquo;re simple. Simplicity
done wrong makes things a lot harder and more complicated to develop and
operate. Programmers and operations staff end up reimplementing (badly) things
the database should do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody argued this line of reasoning more vigorously than when trying to defend
relational databases, especially during the darkest years (ca.  2009-2010), when
NoSQL still meant &lt;strong&gt;NO SQL DAMMIT&lt;/strong&gt;, all sorts of NoSQL databases were
sprouting, and most of them were massively overhyped.  But as valid as those
arguments against NoSQL&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;false economy&amp;rdquo; simplicity were and are, the arguments
against relational databases&amp;rsquo; complexity hold true, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/12/puzzle.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Puzzle&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that no database is really simple. Databases have a lot of
functionality and behaviors&amp;mdash;even the &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; databases do&amp;mdash;and require
deep knowledge to use well when reliability, correctness, and performance are
important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;eventual-consistency-is-hard&#34;&gt;Eventual Consistency is Hard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventual consistency is hard to work with because developers bear extra burden.
I suppose the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf&#34;&gt;Dynamo
paper&lt;/a&gt; is
the best source to cite:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dynamo targets the design space of an “always writeable” data store&amp;hellip;
This requirement forces us to push the complexity of conflict resolution to
the reads in order to ensure that writes are never rejected&amp;hellip; The next design
choice is who performs the process of conflict resolution. This can be done by
the data store or the application. If conflict resolution is done by the data
store, its choices are rather limited&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One can trivially quote this out of context and argue that a bunch of
database logic ends up being reimplemented in the application at read time,
everywhere a read occurs. Indeed, sometimes this extreme does occur. Some use
cases might actually need to check and reconcile conflicting updates with every
single read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find lots of other examples of this type of complexity in similar
systems, such as the &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/dev/using/conflict-resolution/&#34;&gt;Riak
documentation&lt;/a&gt;,
which has lofty-sounding phrases like &amp;ldquo;causal context&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;dotted version
vectors.&amp;rdquo; It does sound like one would need a PhD to use such a system, doesn&amp;rsquo;t
it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When challenged in this way, many NoSQL advocates would respond that tradeoffs
are necessary in distributed systems, and perhaps bring up the CAP Theorem,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://aphyr.com/tags/jepsen&#34;&gt;Jepsen&lt;/a&gt; and so forth.  These kinds of topics are
similar to Schroedinger&amp;rsquo;s Cat, or double-slit experiments, or whatnot.
Relatively ignorant people like me bring these up around the pool table and
argue about them to try to sound smart, without knowing much about them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/12/schroedingers-cat.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;schroedinger&#39;s cat&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distributed systems are hard!  There&amp;rsquo;s no denying that. But is there a better
way?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-simple-are-relational-systems-anyway&#34;&gt;How Simple Are Relational Systems Anyway?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this distributed systems theory and eventual consistency and so on&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s
enough to make you long for the simplicity of a good old relational database,
isn&amp;rsquo;t it? &amp;ldquo;Everyone knows&amp;rdquo; that servers are massively powerful these days. Your
favorite relational database of choice is claimed to be capable of scaling
vertically to all but the most incredibly large-scale applications. So why not
just do that, and keep it simple?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about that word, simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simplicity in relational systems is only achieved when there&amp;rsquo;s no concurrency.
Add in concurrency, and all the complexity of distributed systems comes home to
roost, because distributed and concurrent are fundamentally about solving some
of the same problems. In fact, unless you&amp;rsquo;re running a single-writer,
single-reader database on a single-core server&amp;mdash;and maybe not even then, I&amp;rsquo;m
not sure&amp;mdash;you actually have a distributed system inside your server.
Everything&amp;rsquo;s distributed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I&amp;#39;m not impressed with serializable isolation via a single writer mutex.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Preetam Jinka (@PreetamJinka) &lt;a href=&#34;//twitter.com/PreetamJinka/status/537313622410952704&#34;&gt;November 25, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concurrent operation isn&amp;rsquo;t a nice-to-have in most systems, it&amp;rsquo;s a given.
The way many relational systems handle concurrency is with this nifty little
thing called Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC). It&amp;rsquo;s way simpler than
eventual consistency. (Sarcasm alert!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It works a little like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are four standard transaction isolation levels, each with their own
kinds of constraints and tradeoffs. Each defines which kinds of bad,
inconsistent behaviors aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In REPEATABLE READ, the isolation level that a lot of people consider ideal,
you get &amp;ldquo;read snapshots&amp;rdquo; that let you see an unchanging view of the database over
time. Even as it&amp;rsquo;s changing underneath you! This is implemented by keeping
old row versions until they are no longer needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other isolation levels, such as READ COMMITTED, are &amp;ldquo;bad.&amp;rdquo; Because they don&amp;rsquo;t
protect you, the developer, from the complexity of the underlying
implementation. And they don&amp;rsquo;t allow you a true ACID experience.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; A true ACID
experience is about Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and
Durability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back to REPEATABLE READ, the only isolation level that is approved by the
Holy See. It&amp;rsquo;s really simple. Everything appears just like you are the only
user in the system. As a developer, you can just work with the database
logically as you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to think about other
transactions happening concurrently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this is much better than eventually consistent databases, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-rabbit-hole-that-is-mvcc&#34;&gt;The Rabbit-Hole That Is MVCC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the relational databases and their MVCCs are far from such a
utopia. The reality is that MVCC is way more complex than I&amp;rsquo;ve described.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/12/alice-down-the-rabbit-hole.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;alice-down-the-rabbit-hole&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MVCC and the ACID properties are intertwined in very complex ways. The first
problem comes from the ACID properties themselves.  These four properties are
almost universally misunderstood. It&amp;rsquo;s almost as bad as the CAP theorem. I have
to look up the definitions myself every single time. And then I always
wind up asking myself, &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rsquo;s the difference between Consistency and
Isolation again?&amp;rdquo; Because the definitions seem like each one is halfway about the
other, and there&amp;rsquo;s no consistent way to think about them in isolation from each
other.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, isolation levels. Every database implements them differently. There&amp;rsquo;s a
lot of disagreement about the right way to implement each of the isolation
levels, and this must have been an issue when the standards were written,
because the standards leave a lot unspecified. Most databases are pretty
opinionated, by contrast. Here&amp;rsquo;s what
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/transaction-iso.html&#34;&gt;PostgreSQL says&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason that PostgreSQL only provides three isolation levels is that this
is &lt;em&gt;the only sensible way&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to map the standard isolation levels to the
multiversion concurrency control architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And MySQL, &lt;a href=&#34;http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/set-transaction.html&#34;&gt;via InnoDB&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;InnoDB supports each of the transaction isolation levels described here using
different locking strategies. You can enforce a high degree of consistency
with the default REPEATABLE READ level, for operations on crucial data where
ACID compliance is important. Or you can relax the consistency rules with READ
COMMITTED or even READ UNCOMMITTED, in situations such as bulk reporting where
precise consistency and repeatable results are less important than minimizing
the amount of overhead for locking. SERIALIZABLE enforces even stricter rules
than REPEATABLE READ, and is used mainly in specialized situations, such as
with XA transactions and for troubleshooting issues with concurrency and
deadlocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a glance, it sounds like MySQL/InnoDB asserts that all four levels can be
sensibly implemented, in contradiction to PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s documentation. We&amp;rsquo;ll dig
into this more later. For the moment it&amp;rsquo;s enough to note that InnoDB&amp;rsquo;s MVCC behavior
is more similar to Oracle&amp;rsquo;s than it is to PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s, but still, the docs say
things like &amp;ldquo;A somewhat Oracle-like isolation level with respect to consistent
(nonlocking) reads.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From experience I know that Microsoft SQL Server&amp;rsquo;s locking and multiversion
concurrency model is different yet again. So there&amp;rsquo;s at least four different
implementations with very different behaviors&amp;mdash;and we haven&amp;rsquo;t even gotten to
other databases. For example, Jim Starkey&amp;rsquo;s failed Falcon storage engine
for MySQL was going to use &amp;ldquo;pure MVCC&amp;rdquo; in contradistinction to InnoDB&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;mixed
MVCC,&amp;rdquo; whatever that means. Falcon, naturally, also had &amp;ldquo;quirks&amp;rdquo; in its MVCC
implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Serializable isolation is fairly clear, but understanding what the other systems
actually provide is really hard. And even when you understand what they&amp;rsquo;re
supposed to provide, documentation and implementation bugs make it even worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s dig into a few of these implementations a bit and see what&amp;rsquo;s really the
situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;innodb-s-mvcc&#34;&gt;InnoDB&amp;rsquo;s MVCC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;InnoDB&amp;rsquo;s MVCC works, at a high level, by keeping old row versions as long as
they&amp;rsquo;re needed to be able to recreate a consistent snapshot of the past as the
transaction originally saw it, and locking any rows that are modified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are at least four different scenarios to explore (one for each isolation
level), and more in various edge cases. Quirks, let&amp;rsquo;s call them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most obvious case we should look at is REPEATABLE READ, the default. It&amp;rsquo;s
designed to let you select a set of rows and then repeatedly see the same rows
on every subsequent select, as long as you keep your transaction open. As the
docs say,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All consistent reads within the same transaction read the snapshot established
by the first read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds elegant and beautiful. But it turns ugly really, really fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For locking reads (SELECT with FOR UPDATE or LOCK IN SHARE MODE), UPDATE, and
DELETE statements, locking depends on whether the statement uses a unique
index with a unique search condition, or a range-type search condition. For a
unique index with a unique search condition, InnoDB locks only the index
record found, not the gap before it. For other search conditions, InnoDB locks
the index range scanned, using gap locks or next-key locks to block insertions
by other sessions into the gaps covered by the range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the hell just happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The abstraction just
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html&#34;&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s
what.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/12/spiral-watch.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Spiral Watch&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is due to several logical necessities and implementation details.
It&amp;rsquo;s not solely one or the other. The MVCC model is trying to balance a bunch of
things going on concurrently, and there are logical contradictions that can&amp;rsquo;t go
away, no matter how sophisticated the implementation. There are going to be edge
cases that have to be handled with special exceptions in the behavior. And the
implementation details leak through, inevitably. That&amp;rsquo;s what you are seeing above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the logical necessities, for example, is that you can only modify the
latest version of a row (eventually, at least). If you try to update an old version (the version
contained in your consistent snapshot), you&amp;rsquo;re going to get into trouble. There
can (eventually) be only one truth, and conflicting versions of the data aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to be
presented to a user as they are in eventual consistency. For this reason,
various kinds of operations cause you to confront hard questions, such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should the implementation disallow updating rows for which the snapshot has
an out-of-date version, i.e. its version of reality has diverged from the
latest version?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the latest version? Is it the latest committed version, the latest
uncommitted version? What does &amp;ldquo;latest&amp;rdquo; mean? Is it &amp;ldquo;most recently updated by
clock time&amp;rdquo; or is it &amp;ldquo;update by the transaction with the highest sequence
number?&amp;rdquo; Does this vary between isolation levels?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the implementation allows updating rows that are out-of-date (supposing
the previous points have been resolved), what happens? Do you &amp;ldquo;leak&amp;rdquo; out of
your isolation level, hence breaking consistency within your transaction? Do
you fail the transaction? Or do you allow updating an old version, but then
fail at commit time?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if a transaction fails, and how does it fail / how is this
presented to the user? (InnoDB used to deadlock and roll back the whole
transaction; later it was changed to roll back just the failed statement).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally you are going to run into problems such as these. And they have to
be resolved, with various levels of confusion and complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also note that InnoDB actually tries to go above and beyond the SQL
standard. The standard allows phantom reads in REPEATABLE READ, but InnoDB uses next-key
locking and gap locking to avoid this and bring REPEATABLE READ closer to
SERIALIZABLE without the obnoxious locking implied by SERIALIZABLE. PostgreSQL
does the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface of the complexities of how InnoDB handles
transactions, locking, isolation levels, and MVCC. I am not kidding. There is a
large amount of documentation about it in the official manual, much of which
requires serious study to understand. And beyond that, there is a lot that&amp;rsquo;s not
officially documented. For example, here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;//blogs.oracle.com/mysqlinnodb/entry/mysql_5_5_innodb_change&#34;&gt;blog post from one of the InnoDB
authors&lt;/a&gt;
that explains how various performance optimizations impact index operations.
This might seem unrelated, but every access InnoDB makes to data has to interact
with the MVCC rules it implements. And this all has implications for locking,
deadlocks, and so on. Locking in itself is a complex topic in InnoDB. The list goes

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-it-works-in-postgresql&#34;&gt;How It Works In PostgreSQL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sensibly, apparently ;-) Well, seriously, I have a lot less experience with
PostgreSQL. But from the above it&amp;rsquo;s quite clear that the PostgreSQL
documentation writers could find lots of support for a claim that attempting to
implement all four standard isolation levels, at least in the way that InnoDB
does, is not sensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PostgreSQL documentation, unlike the MySQL documentation, is largely limited
to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/transaction-iso.html&#34;&gt;single
page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read cursor isolation docs for Oracle, PG, InnoDB. PG docs are clear, others probably not. Tech writing is hard.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; markcallaghan (@markcallaghan) &lt;a href=&#34;//twitter.com/markcallaghan/status/528335458221449217&#34;&gt;October 31, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, PostgreSQL uses READ COMMITTED by default. This means that if you
SELECT some rows within a transaction, then wait while another transaction
modifies them and commits, then SELECT them again, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the changes.
Whether this is OK is for you to decide. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that a lot of people
run MySQL/InnoDB the same way, and there are lots of bugs and special behaviors
that end up making other isolation levels unusable for various reasons when
various features are used in MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think Mark Callaghan&amp;rsquo;s tweet, embedded above, is largely true. But even the
PostgreSQL docs, as clear as they are, have some things that are hard to parse.
Does the first part of this excerpt contradict the second part? (Emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a SELECT query (without a FOR UPDATE/SHARE clause) sees only data committed
before the query began; it &lt;em&gt;never sees either uncommitted data or changes
committed during query execution by concurrent transactions&lt;/em&gt;. In effect, a
SELECT query sees a snapshot of the database as of the instant the query
begins to run. However, SELECT does see the effects of previous updates
executed within its own transaction, even though they are not yet committed.
Also note that &lt;em&gt;two successive SELECT commands can see different data, even
though they are within a single transaction, if other transactions commit
changes during execution of the first SELECT.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s apparently less complicated MVCC implementation has thorny
questions such as those. On more careful reading, the meaning becomes clear (and
I don&amp;rsquo;t see how to improve it, by the way). The issue remains: these are subtle
topics that inherently require close attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most elegantly put points in this documentation page is the remark
that &amp;ldquo;Consistent use of Serializable transactions can simplify development.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-s-not-just-mysql-and-postgresql&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Not Just MySQL And PostgreSQL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other systems implement some type of MVCC. All of them, as per the name,
rely on multiple versions of records/rows, and deal with the various conflicts
between these multiple versions in various ways. Some more complex, some less.
The behavior the developer sees is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2013/12/28/immutability-mvcc-and-garbage-collection/&#34;&gt;heavily influenced by the underlying
implementation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And developers have to deal with this. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to use one of these
systems competently, you must know the intricacies. I saw this again and
again while consulting with MySQL users. Many developers, including myself, have
written applications that fall afoul of the MVCC implementation and rules. The
results?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Performance problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Availability problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deadlocks and other errors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bugs. Horrible, subtle bugs in the way the app uses the database.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only systems I&amp;rsquo;m aware of that can avoid these problems are those that use
strategies such as single-writer designs. These, contrary to what their
proponents will say about them, generally do not scale well at all. Many a
MyISAM has been reinvented by database developers who don&amp;rsquo;t understand why
MyISAM doesn&amp;rsquo;t scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;back-to-eventual-consistency&#34;&gt;Back To Eventual Consistency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast with that nightmare of complexity, I&amp;rsquo;m not so sure eventual
consistency is really all that hard for developers to deal with. The developers
will &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; need to be aware of the exact behavior of the implementation
they&amp;rsquo;re writing against, relational or not. I&amp;rsquo;ve studied quite a few eventually
consistent databases (although I&amp;rsquo;ll admit I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of my career elbows
deep in InnoDB) and it seems hard to believe Cassandra or Riak is really more
complex to develop against than InnoDB, for the use cases that they serve well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually consistent is easy to ridicule, though. Here&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually consistent &lt;a href=&#34;//twitter.com/hashtag/FiveWordTechHorrors?src=hash&#34;&gt;#FiveWordTechHorrors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Stewart Smith (@stewartsmith) &lt;a href=&#34;//twitter.com/stewartsmith/status/410651205615230976&#34;&gt;December 11, 2013&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&#34;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If you don&amp;rsquo;t get the joke, just wait a while. It&amp;rsquo;ll come to you.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we have the best of all worlds? Can we have transactional behavior with
strong ACID properties, high concurrency, etc, etc? Some claim that we can.
&lt;a href=&#34;//foundationdb.com/&#34;&gt;FoundationDB&lt;/a&gt;, for example, &lt;a href=&#34;//foundationdb.com/acid-claims&#34;&gt;asserts&lt;/a&gt; that
it&amp;rsquo;s possible and that their implementation is fully serializable, calling other
isolation levels weak, i.e.  not true I-as-in-ACID. I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet used
FoundationDB so I can&amp;rsquo;t comment, though I have always been impressed with what
I&amp;rsquo;ve read from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since I am not ready to assert that there&amp;rsquo;s a distributed system I know to
be better and simpler than eventually consistent datastores, and since I
certainly know that InnoDB&amp;rsquo;s MVCC implementation is full of complexities, for
right now I am probably in the same position most of my readers are: the two
viable choices seem to be single-node MVCC and multi-node eventual consistency.
And I don&amp;rsquo;t think MVCC is the simpler paradigm of the two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Pun intended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also note that PostgreSQL used to provide only &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; isolation
levels, and the documentation used to make the same comment about it being
the only sensible thing to do. It&amp;rsquo;s not quite clear to me whether this is
meant to imply that it&amp;rsquo;s the only sensible way to implement MVCC, or the only
sensible way to implement PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s MVCC.&lt;/li&gt;

          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/11/29/code-freezes-dont-prevent-outages/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have $10 that says you&amp;rsquo;ve experienced this before: there&amp;rsquo;s a holiday, trade show, or other important event coming up. Management is worried about the risk of an outage during this all-important time, and restricts deployments from the week prior through the end of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What really happens, of course, is that the system in question becomes booby-trapped with extra risk. As a result, problems are more likely, and when there there is even a slight issue, it has the potential to escalate into a major crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does this happen? As usual, there&amp;rsquo;s no single root cause, but a variety of problems combine to create a brittle, risky situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/11/freeze.png&#34; alt=&#34;freeze&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;assumptions&#34;&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When managers declare a freeze, they&amp;rsquo;re not being malicious. They&amp;rsquo;re doing something that seems to make sense. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand the reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal is simple: prevent breaking something that&amp;rsquo;s working. And a lot of issues seem to trace back to a deployment that breaks a working system, so it&amp;rsquo;s natural to want to avoid a deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumptions, in my experience, are that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the systems are working now&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;systems break because of change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;restricting change will prevent breakage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the riskiest change is deployment, so restricting deployment eliminates risky change&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;potential downsides are less costly than potential outages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the assumptions are wrong, which is why deployment freezes often have the opposite of the intended effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;change-breaks-things&#34;&gt;Change Breaks Things&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s true that change breaks things, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t tell the whole story. The reality is that systems are always changing, even when you think they&amp;rsquo;re not. And they&amp;rsquo;re also broken. Right now. You just don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first great lie is that you can stop systems from changing. You can&amp;rsquo;t stop change. As Charity Majors &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/618170448652582912&#34;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, the image below is &amp;ldquo;one of the greatest lies in computer science.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/11/nothing-changes.png&#34; alt=&#34;If you do nothing, nothing happens&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipping code is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the only change in a system. Unless the system is turned off completely, it&amp;rsquo;s changing every instant. User requests are being served. Logs are being written. Cron jobs and other scheduled tasks are starting, running, and stopping. The system clock is advancing. There are also dependencies on other systems, which likewise are undergoing constant change. And there are requirements changes, which nobody ever thinks about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these changes happen all the time and nothing goes wrong, or humans adjust and fix things as a matter of course. But many of these changes actually expose corner-case bugs or weird problems that just aren&amp;rsquo;t tickled often. As a result, you get the illusion that your systems are not broken. And that&amp;rsquo;s the second great lie, because your systems &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; broken. You just don&amp;rsquo;t know it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s broken? All sorts of things. Your Java runtime has a time bug that&amp;rsquo;s waiting to throw it into an infinite loop when a leap second happens. Your website has a SQL injection vulnerability that nobody&amp;rsquo;s exploited yet. A set of servers that you bought all together and installed at the same time has a ticking time bomb in the RAID controllers, which are all going to go into degraded self-test mode simultaneously. Your auto-increment integer column is  crossing the 2 billion mark right now, and will soon reach its max value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that practically every running system is a ticking time bomb. You just don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s ticking or how long till it stops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/11/clock.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;clock&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;uncontrolled-change-is-more-dangerous&#34;&gt;Uncontrolled Change Is More Dangerous&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, I&amp;rsquo;m not demonizing your managers. They&amp;rsquo;re actually right to think that deployments are riskier and are likely to cause breaking changes. That&amp;rsquo;s because deployment is often a barely-controlled change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generally, the more automated (scripted) the deployment is, the safer. This is actually not because of the automation, but because of an effect of automation. With automated deployment in place, deployment usually becomes a more frequent process, which tends to exercise, expose, and remove sources of risk to a larger extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the headline of this section is wrong, in a way. Uncontrolled change isn&amp;rsquo;t what&amp;rsquo;s dangerous. Infrequent change is the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait! Isn&amp;rsquo;t that precisely the opposite of what the managers are asking? Aren&amp;rsquo;t they asking us to freeze deployments &lt;em&gt;in order to slow the pace of change and decrease risk?&lt;/em&gt;  Yep, that&amp;rsquo;s right. Their intuition is actually the reverse of the truth: to make the systems safer, they should be encouraging more deployments, not fewer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deplyoment freezes actually add risk. But that&amp;rsquo;s not all. The deployoment freeze sets in place a vicious cycle that includes a couple of other effects and spirals down and down. Watch as I show you how the deplyoment freeze is only the first step in how we ambush the operations engineers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/11/raccoon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;excellent smithers&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-can-t-freeze-deployments&#34;&gt;You Can&amp;rsquo;t Freeze Deployments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Freezes never, but &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt;, work. You can declare a freeze, but you can&amp;rsquo;t make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This follows naturally from the inability to actually stop the systems from changing. Systems that change are going to break, and you have to respond to this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other effects, too. Requirements change, for example. The catalog merchants went to the marketers and decided to offer a special promo. Buy a tablet and a case in combination with a warranty, and get a bluetooth keyboard free! Sounds great; we&amp;rsquo;ll make a bundle &amp;ndash; let&amp;rsquo;s print and ship those catalogs. Just in time for the holidays! Whoops, nobody told IT about this. Catalogs are printed already. We&amp;rsquo;ve got two weeks and there&amp;rsquo;s no going back; we need the order-entry system and the website to support this promo. Bingo; forced change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a promo or a bugfix, something always has to be changed. So we always have to break the rule. This is why the rule inevitably ends up being &lt;em&gt;no deployments except for emergency changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is getting good. What&amp;rsquo;s riskier than a change? An emergency change. What&amp;rsquo;s riskier still? Undeployed code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;undeployed-code-is-inventory-inventory-is-risk&#34;&gt;Undeployed Code Is Inventory; Inventory Is Risk&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of developing and deploying code is really a process of forking and merging your codebase. A developer writes a new version of the application, which diverges from what&amp;rsquo;s running in production. The developer then merges it back in and deploys it to production, resolving the differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are at least two key points where &lt;em&gt;inventory&lt;/em&gt; of risk builds up in this process. The first is when the developer&amp;rsquo;s codebase isn&amp;rsquo;t merged into the main code yet. The longer this waits, and the more the code diverges, the riskier. Secondly, after merging and before deployment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code that has been merged and not deployed is a loaded gun. If I merge in my changes and don&amp;rsquo;t deploy them, and you then merge and deploy yours, you&amp;rsquo;ve just deployed mine too. This was more than you bargained for. It&amp;rsquo;s now more likely that your deployment will break something, and harder for you to fix if it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a deployment freeze, two important things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lots of latent changes build up, ready to break the whole world when the freeze is lifted. &lt;em&gt;There is increasing risk of breaking the system after the freeze.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Every developer&amp;rsquo;s codebase, and knowledge of the codebase, is diverging from production. Development and QA environments typically are, too. As a result, when emergency changes have to be applied to production during the freeze, breakage is much more likely. &lt;em&gt;There is increasing risk of breaking the system during the freeze.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;frozen-systems-are-inoperable&#34;&gt;Frozen Systems are Inoperable&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve seen that the tip of the codebase is where the least risk has accumulated. The tip is where things work best. Frozen systems get further behind this tip, and therefore much riskier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure is code, too. Frozen systems also become incompatible with the current tip of environment configuration and infrastructure automation code. The result is that emergency deployments are often done outside of normal change control procedures, and the usual automation and deployment code can&amp;rsquo;t be used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this problem, consider that app code and automation code are usually separate, although there is a dependency. This dependency is not properly versioned most of the time. Is your Puppet code version-controlled in lockstep with your application code, such that if you want to deploy a stale version of the app code, the deployment process will check out and use the older Puppet code? Would this even work, if it were possible &amp;ndash; can you just run old Puppet code on systems that have been advanced forward? The answer to both of these questions is likely no.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine trying to drive your car without all the usual help you get from it: no mirrors, no gauges, no power steering, no power brakes. A car with all these things disabled is largely inoperable for most people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A system that&amp;rsquo;s stale in production for a month, while developers work actively on a bunch of unshipped changes, is in a similar state. Important controls, indicators, and assists are disabled. It&amp;rsquo;s largely inoperable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve seen that a deployment freeze can&amp;rsquo;t prevent the need for changes. Now we see that it forces the inevitable changes to be done in a much more dangerous way, seriously increasing the risk of problems. Looks like the freeze is not preventing the risk of an outage as intended!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cost-of-deployment-freezes&#34;&gt;The Cost Of Deployment Freezes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assumption is that the downsides of a deployment freeze are outweighed by the benefit of avoiding outages. I&amp;rsquo;m arguing that the benefit is much smaller than expected, and may even be negative. What about the costs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deployment freezes have a huge productivity cost. Huge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you can&amp;rsquo;t deploy, you can&amp;rsquo;t resolve the temporary tension in the system that results from changes that aren&amp;rsquo;t merged or deployed. Many changes you make while developing the system have to go through a compatibility lifecycle: to mutate from state A to B, you must first go to AB, which is backwards compatible with A and forward compatible with B. Then you move from AB to B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple example is adding a column to a table. You make sure the code ignores new columns, add the column with a default value, then make the code recognize and work with the new column, then remove the default value once it&amp;rsquo;s no longer needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of compatibility lifecycle represents a set of &lt;em&gt;dependencies&lt;/em&gt; across time. If you&amp;rsquo;ve read The Goal, you know dependencies are bad for workflow. These dependencies become blockers for developers working on the code, and even for other developers and operations staff. If the dependencies are short-lived, it often isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad. This is the case when you deploy a dozen times a day. But if the dependencies become long-lived, large portions of engineering slows down or stops completely. Projects have to be shelved until things can be deployed. Meanwhile, work that&amp;rsquo;s been done on these projects becomes stale and creates conflicts with alternative work. It often has to be reworked later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was a local change and dependency becomes, given a little more time, a global blocker and waste of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenario is practically certain to happen. Deployment freezes crush productivity, often long beyond the duration of the freeze itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-feature-freezes&#34;&gt;What About Feature Freezes?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fairly common for large, complex, fast-moving systems to declare feature freezes in preparation for a major release. (Think of versions of operating systems or databases, for example.) However, this is different from a deployment freeze in a web appication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important difference is that a deployment freeze is an attempt to branch the infrastructure, code/app, data, system state, and activity (customers/users). This is not branching one thing, but many interdependent things. This is practically impossible to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frozen systems can run as-is briefly, but then pressure to change them mounts steeply. The system grows stale, but things change anyway and force changes. These changes become much more difficult and dangerous, and the likelihood of an outage grows quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Code freezes thus make systems more likely to break, while impacting productivity. Both the cost and the risk are much worse than intuition would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that a focus on improving the processes by which changes are made, making smaller and more frequent iterations, and finding out and fixing breakage as soon as possible is a better way to the goal. But that&amp;rsquo;s a different article&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What have your experiences been? Let me know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t you like to find the root cause of that downtime incident? Many people
would. But experience has taught me that there is no such thing as a single root
cause. Instead, there&amp;rsquo;s a chain of interrelated causes, each of which is
necessary but none of which is sufficient to cause the overall problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/07/turtles.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Turtles&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am often reminded of an outage years ago. It was &amp;ldquo;caused&amp;rdquo; by a failed disk.
But the disk was in a RAID5 array, and another disk in that array had failed
some time previously. Backups had also failed some time previously, so there
were no backups. Health checks didn&amp;rsquo;t notify anyone of the degraded disk array,
due to a misconfigured alerting system. Alerting and backups failed because the
person in charge of operations was not performing his duties.  The operations
person was still in the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat because of management dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you really want to get to the root cause of a problem, you need to use the
Five Whys approach. I rarely do that because I already know where it ends. The
CEO or equivalent is always the problem. It&amp;rsquo;s turtles all the way down (or up).
Saying that the CEO is ultimately responsible is true but useless. The CEO is
ultimately responsible for &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why the search for a root cause is usually a witch-hunt in disguise, trying
to find someone or something to blame. If you think there is really a single
cause, you eventually must identify a single person. If you stop short of that,
everyone knows the process was a farce. But blaming a person is also a farce.
Everyone knows that someone&amp;rsquo;s being thrown under the bus and that wasn&amp;rsquo;t the
real problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several solutions to this dilemma. One is to stop looking for a
&lt;em&gt;single&lt;/em&gt; root cause, and instead identify the &lt;em&gt;system&lt;/em&gt; of conditions or
dysfunctions that jointly caused the observed problem. This allows something
constructive to come out of the postmortem, instead of inexorably bringing
pressure to bear on a well-meaning person who will then be sacrificed to appease
the false gods of reductionist blame-gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another is to change the culture and own failures as opportunities. Navigating
this can be tricky. I&amp;rsquo;ve heard from more than one person who was fired from a
workforce with a supposedly &amp;ldquo;blameless culture&amp;rdquo; policy after tripping over a
booby-trap. I haven&amp;rsquo;t attended one yet, but I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that Dave Zwieback&amp;rsquo;s
postmortem workshops are excellent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more people I speak to are either doubtful or outright reject
root-cause analysis these days. That&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. I used to be pressured for
root-cause analysis years ago, and there was always an airtight and unspoken
assumption that &lt;em&gt;of course&lt;/em&gt; such a thing exists and is the right way to handle
the aftermath of an incident. I&amp;rsquo;m happy the times are changing. These days, even
some companies have stopped saying their tools or products can find root causes.
Maybe this trend will allow us to replace the manifest failures of root-cause
analysis with something more helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Focus is perhaps the most important attribute in an organization. In fact, my dictionary defines an organization as &amp;ldquo;an organized body of people with a particular purpose&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; A focused organization recognizes and cleaves to its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the ability to create and sustain focus is perhaps the most valuable skill of the organization&amp;rsquo;s members, including both individual contributors and leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/05/rainbokeh.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rainbokeh&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-focus-and-why-is-it-hard&#34;&gt;What Is Focus, And Why Is It Hard?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dictionary says focus is &amp;ldquo;an act of concentrating.&amp;rdquo; Consider the root words: &lt;em&gt;concentrate&lt;/em&gt; literally means to bring to a common center, to be centered together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, I think of focus as a &lt;em&gt;resource&lt;/em&gt; similar to time, money, goodwill, and other more-or-less-fungible things. I claim that focus is usually an organization&amp;rsquo;s most valuable, most threatened, and scarcest resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I base this claim on my life experience. I have never worked at an organization that was too focused. I have never heard anyone describe an organization objectively as doing too few things too thoroughly, prioritizing excellence in execution too highly. Focus always seems to be under pressure; there always seems to be a gravitational pull away from focus, towards distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this? I believe it&amp;rsquo;s because ideas can be conceived in a flash, but execution takes time. In a moment of inspiration, I can envision a completed product or project. I can allow myself the thrill of dreaming about the benefits. How much better life would be with this-or-that! How much I would enjoy that! How much I&amp;rsquo;d like the satisfaction of having achieved this utopian ideal, this perfection!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sobering reality is that achieving such a vision takes a long time and goes through many unexpected detours. Focus is hard precisely because inspiration is fleeting. We&amp;rsquo;re drawn into the tedious, neverending details of execution, yet the goal appears to remain as far away as ever. We long for the satisfaction of accomplishment, and it&amp;rsquo;s human to desire it &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of this struggle, this discipline of delaying gratification, it&amp;rsquo;s so tempting to daydream of new ideas again. It&amp;rsquo;s rewarding because the indulgence of &amp;ldquo;wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be wonderful&amp;rdquo; thoughts actually creates surges of pleasure responses such as endorphins. Distraction is an enticing, seductive drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fear-is-anti-focus&#34;&gt;Fear Is Anti-Focus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be demotivating to acknowledge the reality that achieving the dream is a marathon, not a sprint. This is actually a fear response. The thought &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll never finish&lt;/em&gt; is a lie; the truth is &lt;em&gt;I fear I&amp;rsquo;ll never finish&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, many of the reasons it can be hard to focus are just fear in different guises. New ideas are alluring in part due to the fear of what might happen if you don&amp;rsquo;t pursue them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I don&amp;rsquo;t do this new thing I&amp;rsquo;ve just thought about, someone else will do it first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I might forget my new idea, or the reasons that I think it&amp;rsquo;s good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I might lose the opportunity to do it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear is the voice of a pathological liar in your head. Fear says &lt;em&gt;this is real&lt;/em&gt; when the truth is &lt;em&gt;this isn&amp;rsquo;t real yet, but it could become real, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like it if it did.&lt;/em&gt; You can see this by noting that fears are always about a potential future; if it&amp;rsquo;s reality already, you might suffer, but you won&amp;rsquo;t fear. And fears are not about the circumstance, but about your projected response to it. I wrote &lt;em&gt;wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like&lt;/em&gt; above, but the truth is &lt;em&gt;might not like&lt;/em&gt;. For example, the correct translation of &lt;em&gt;I fear getting old&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;I fear that I might get old, and if I do, I might not like it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the appeal of a new idea is often partially infused with urgency, based on fear of what might happen if you don&amp;rsquo;t pursue the idea, and how you imagine you might feel about that outcome if it comes to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/05/perfection.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Perfection&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;focus-is-worth-striving-for&#34;&gt;Focus Is Worth Striving For&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of focusing is simple: efficiency. The more concentrated your efforts, the more effective they&amp;rsquo;ll be. Your results will appear sooner, your work will flow more joyfully and easily, and your outcome will be better quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you examine some of the effects of distraction, the benefits of focus should become clear. I won&amp;rsquo;t belabor this point, but I&amp;rsquo;ll note that every new activity or idea has a compound effect. We tend to be biased to see the potential benefits much more than the likely drawbacks, which is part of why new ideas are so alluring. We see, for example, that a new product feature will enrich and enable and empower. But do we see that to do it right, we&amp;rsquo;re obligated to integrate it smoothly with all existing and future product features, to maintain it, to test it, to train, to document, to support? &lt;a href=&#34;http://firstround.com/article/the-one-cost-engineers-and-product-managers-dont-consider&#34;&gt;Usually not&lt;/a&gt;. We usually see compound benefits, but neglect to see compounded costs and risks, especially those that come from failure to execute fully and excellently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus is putting what’s most important first and protecting its right to be there.
(typically by saying &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo; to everything else) &amp;mdash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://vanessahurst.com/post/83405785577/focus-is-putting-whats-most-important-first-and&#34;&gt;Vanessa Hurst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people I admire achieve amazing things precisely because they complete one thing and then build something new on top of it, rather than always having everything in a glorious state of perfect incompletion. The &amp;ldquo;secret&amp;rdquo; to their success is the willpower to patiently bring things to completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I often think about focus in terms of WIP (work-in-progress), a term you&amp;rsquo;ll hear in Lean, Agile, Kanban, and other circles. Focus and WIP are inversely related. Focus is the ability to say &amp;ldquo;not yet,&amp;rdquo; to finish work in progress before starting new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The danger of not doing this &amp;mdash; the danger of saying yes to opportunity &amp;mdash; is that you&amp;rsquo;ll load so much gold into the boat that you sink the whole thing. I find it helpful to consider each new opportunity or idea from this perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you have too much focus? Certainly, but it&amp;rsquo;s not focus. It&amp;rsquo;s perfectionism, which is another type of fear. In my experience, individuals can be perfectionists, but organizations &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen that. And even perfectionist individuals suffer from a perverse lack of focus, because they focus on the perfection of the thing they want to achieve, rather than the benefits they want to achieve. Focusing on the benefits you want is an antidote to perfectionism. I write from deep personal experience on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to point out that the type of execution-to-completion I&amp;rsquo;m discussing is emphatically not anti-Agile. Shipping early and often is part of getting something to completion as soon as possible, achieving the best final product, and lowering waste. Completion and excellence in execution are often conflated with perfectionism and reluctance to release partial work. They&amp;rsquo;re not the same, and treating them as synonymous is a huge mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-politics-of-focus&#34;&gt;The Politics Of Focus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a manager, it can be difficult to help your team stay focused, because you need to coach them through their natural impatience and discouragement without demotivating them. This is no easy thing, but nobody said management is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it&amp;rsquo;s true that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paperplanes.de/2014/6/2/focus-starts-by-saying-no.html&#34;&gt;focus starts with saying no&lt;/a&gt;, say it carefully. Someone who has a good idea that is struck down can easily take it personally, especially if the idea was rejected ingraciously. It helps to put the emphasis on the idea and not the person. It also helps to take the emphasis &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from the idea and draw it back towards the work in progress, and the outcome you&amp;rsquo;re working for &amp;mdash; to redirect the conversation into a &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; for something else, instead of saying &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to the idea itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion is to avoid saying &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; and to say &amp;ldquo;yes, later&amp;rdquo; instead. This is itself a way of focusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/05/fossil.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Shell&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminding people of the progress they&amp;rsquo;re making can also be helpful. While you&amp;rsquo;re in the weeds executing on a vision, progress becomes difficult to see. If you can help people remember what things were like a month ago, they might be reminded of how much progress they&amp;rsquo;re making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another helpful reminder is that the distracting idea or opportunity isn&amp;rsquo;t a good thing &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s only the vision of the possibility of a good thing. This can segue nicely into rekindling passion for what&amp;rsquo;s currently underway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all the superior effort you&amp;rsquo;ve put into what you&amp;rsquo;ve done thus far, but which isn&amp;rsquo;t yet producing any benefit? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice to see that through? Can you remember the original vision for that project, and how excited we were about making that a reality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be patient with people who have ideas you don&amp;rsquo;t want to pursue right away. Let them work through the ideas with you, help them come to terms with any fears (conscious or not), and use their passion and enthusiasm as a springboard for redirecting energy into the current project. Nothing kills the &lt;em&gt;esprit de corps&lt;/em&gt; quite as fast as a naysayer who just shuts things down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;evaluating-opportunities&#34;&gt;Evaluating Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many ideas and opportunities &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; worth considering seriously, and some are worth pursuing. Through experience I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled onto a model that has worked for me thus far. It&amp;rsquo;s based on two questions that require considerable thought and care:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are the current efforts and work-in-progress producing good outcomes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we do more of the same (i.e. execute to the vision), will we magnify our existing success?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the answers are yes, then it might not be best to engage in new ideas or opportunities, no matter how good they are. Beware of loading your plate with more than you need to eat. Ask yourself two additional questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are boredom and missed opportunities the only risks of staying the course we&amp;rsquo;ve set?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are novelty and expanded opportunity the main benefits of beginning something new?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;worldview&#34;&gt;Worldview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focused organizations are made of focused people. It&amp;rsquo;s that simple. If your people can&amp;rsquo;t focus, then the organization will be less focused. If they can, then the organization can be single-minded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking personally, my patience and ability to continue working on things that are in progress, and my reluctance to admit distraction, is not something I was born with. Remaining serene and keeping an eye on the goal is a skill that I believe anyone can nurture and grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, it&amp;rsquo;s now part of my underlying worldview. I believe, and my experience has been, that whatever I focus on, whatever I give my attention to, will gradually become my reality. I believe that mindfulness &amp;mdash; the ability to observe choose my thoughts, and by proxy to direct my thoughts intentionally &amp;mdash; is the source of my ability to direct my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/05/cityscape.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cityscape&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a child, I attended a workshop with Pat Parelli, a master horseman and trainer of people. His phrase has stayed with me through many years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Causing is somewhere between making and letting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I notice and release distracting thoughts, what is it but focus? When I choose my thoughts with care and intention, what is this other than focus?  And every time I do this, I &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; myself to contribute to my desired goals, by training myself to become better at giving attention to things I want, and withdrawing attention from things I don&amp;rsquo;t want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-advice&#34;&gt;My Advice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice, should you wish to hear it, is to consider that mental effort defeats itself. You can&amp;rsquo;t force yourself to focus. The harder you try, the more you&amp;rsquo;ll spin your wheels. It must be effortless and relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to avoid effort is to become interested in what you want. The ability to create genuine interest within yourself is a skill. You can do it if you can direct your thoughts to the things you want. And training yourself to be able to direct your thoughts is not only possible, it&amp;rsquo;s the single most valuable skill you could ever acquire, because it will multiply your efforts in every other area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than fighting or working for focus, I suggest that you become a focused person through a daily practice of your choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s practice will be different. The key is to find something that works for you, and is so rewarding that you find it indispensable &amp;mdash; something you &amp;ldquo;couldn&amp;rsquo;t live without.&amp;rdquo; If you don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start, ask advice from people you admire. If you want what they have gotten, consider doing what they have done. Look at anyone else in your life and assess them the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll give a couple of examples. One is mindfulness and meditation. For an example, see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2014/04/meditation-narrative.html&#34;&gt;Brad Feld&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;. He has written a great deal about the benefits he&amp;rsquo;s seen since beginning to practice meditation. His personal practice is based on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.getsomeheadspace.com/&#34;&gt;Headspace Project&lt;/a&gt;, which I can also say has worked well for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example is Martin Luther (not Martin Luther King Jr), who is quoted as saying &amp;ldquo;I have so much to do that I shall spend the first three hours in prayer.&amp;rdquo; Beginning each day with intentionality gets things off on the right foot. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that three hours is necessary for everyone. Three minutes works wonders for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third is physical activity. Many people find specific things conducive to focus: running, knitting, swimming, showering. If you can get some focus and quietude of mind doing something like that, then try to integrate it into the rest of your time as well. For me, it used to be rock climbing. That was the only time I felt focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I use both prayer and meditation to achieve mindfulness every day and carry it through all my activities. Years ago I met an elderly man, an architect, who spoke of his lifelong practice of transcendental meditation and how beneficial it had been. I asked him to be my teacher, and he spent a lot of time coaching me in meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I found I could not sustain the practice he passed on to me. Perhaps it was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn it well enough, or perhaps it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite right for me. Whatever the reason, it was something I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; live without, and because it was non-essential I gradually drifted out of the habit of doing it every day. After some time I found two small tweaks that made it much easier for me, and that made all the difference. (The tweaks were meditating for a slightly shorter time, and focusing on my breath instead of a mantra. Your mileage will vary.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the following pieces of scripture immensely inspiring:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. &amp;mdash; Matthew 6:21-22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for one&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;eye to be single&lt;/em&gt;? My interpretation is that it means to cast your attention on only one thing. The overall meaning I find in these verses is that choosing a goal, choosing to regard your goal as a treasure you desire, and concentrating on it, will motivate you towards creating that outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this is the essence of focus for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be still, and know that I am God.
&amp;mdash; Psalm 46:10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you success in all your endeavours, and hope you&amp;rsquo;ve found this article helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

          <pubDate>Sun, 08 Jun 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/06/08/time-series-database-requirements/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had conversations about time-series databases with many people over the last couple of years. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/03/02/time-series-databases-influxdb/&#34;&gt;wrote previously&lt;/a&gt; about some of the open-source technologies that people commonly use for time-series storage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/06/timeseries.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Time Series&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I have my own ideas about what constitutes a good time-series database, and because a few people have asked me to describe my requirements, I have decided to publish my thoughts here. All opinions that follow are my own, and as you read you should mentally add &amp;ldquo;in my opinion&amp;rdquo; to every sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, I currently have an efficient time-series database that is working well. It is &lt;a href=&#34;https://vividcortex.com//blog/2014/04/30/why-mysql/&#34;&gt;built on MySQL&lt;/a&gt;. This is a high bar for a replacement to jump over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;definition-of-data-type&#34;&gt;Definition of Data Type&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my purposes, time-series can be defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A series is identified by a source name or ID (for example: host ID) and a metric name or ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A series consists of a sequence of {timestamp, value} measurements ordered by timestamp, where the timestamp is probably a high-precision Unix timestamp and the value is a floating-point number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;workload-characteristics&#34;&gt;Workload Characteristics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time-series data is not general-purpose and has specific patterns in its workload. A time-series database should be optimized for the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write-mostly is the norm; perhaps 95% to 99% of operations are writes, sometimes higher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writes are almost always sequential appends; they almost always arrive in time order. There is a caveat to this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writes to the distant past are rare. Most measurements are written within a few seconds or minutes after being observed, in the worst case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updates are rare.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deletes are in bulk, beginning at the start of history and proceeding in contiguous blocks. Deletes of individual measurements or deletes from random locations in history are rare. Efficient bulk deletes are important; as close to zero cost as possible. Non-bulk deletes need not be optimal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Due to the above, an immutable storage format is potentially a good thing. As a further consequence of immutable storage, a predefined or fixed schema may be a problem long-term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reads, the following usually holds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data is much larger than memory and rarely read, so caching typically doesn&amp;rsquo;t work well; systems are often IO-bound.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reads are typically logically sequential per-series, ascending or descending.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concurrent reads and reads of multiple series at once are reasonably common.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The caveat to &amp;ldquo;writes arrive in sequential order&amp;rdquo; is that measurements typically arrive ordered by {timestamp, series_id}, but reads are typically done in {series_id, timestamp} order. Reads need to be fast, even though they are rare. There are generally two approaches to dealing with this. The first is to write efficiently, so the data isn&amp;rsquo;t read-optimized per-series on disk, and deploy massive amounts of compute power in parallel for reads, scanning through all the data linearly. The second is to pay a penalty on writes, so the data is tightly packed by series and optimized for sequential reads of a series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;performance-and-scaling-characteristics&#34;&gt;Performance and Scaling Characteristics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A time-series database should be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed by design &amp;mdash; no bolt-on clustering or sharding. Automatic data distribution, automatic query distribution. Fault-tolerant and highly available, with built-in replication and automatic failover. I think by this point we should all understand what it means for a database to be natively distributed. There are several good examples of databases that do it sensibly, and little of this should need to be novel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send the query to the data, don&amp;rsquo;t bring the data to the query. This is a restatement of &amp;ldquo;automatic query distribution.&amp;rdquo; Queries may touch many gigabytes or terabytes of data, so moving it across the network is not scalable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Efficient per-node so it is capable of running at large scale without requiring thousands of servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Able to take advantage of powerful hardware: PCIe flash storage, lots of RAM, many CPU cores. This rules out single-writer systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fast and consistent. No spikes or stalls; no checkpoint freezes; no compaction lock-ups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;operational-requirements&#34;&gt;Operational Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I do not specifically need ACID, but I need the database to quickly recover to a consistent state after events like a power failure. For my purposes, time-series data is not subject to the same durability constraints as financial data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-blocking backups are a must. Incremental backups are a very good thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It needs to be possible to scale the cluster up or down without downtime or locking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compressed storage. Time-series data is big, but highly compressible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The database should be well instrumented.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;language-and-or-api-design&#34;&gt;Language and/or API Design&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to many people who have built large-scale time-series databases for big companies. Most of them have told me that the lack of a high-level way to access and query the database was the long-term millstone around their neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be happy with something that looks like SQL, as InfluxDB&amp;rsquo;s query language does. Crucially, it needs to avoid a few of the legacy limitations of SQL. The way I think about it is that SQL tables are fixed-width and grow downwards by adding rows. A natural outcome of that is that each column in SQL statements is known in advance and explicitly named, and expressions naturally work within a single row or in aggregates over groups of rows, but cannot span rows otherwise without doing a JOIN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/06/theater.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Theater&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in time-series databases, rows are series identified by the &amp;ldquo;primary key.&amp;rdquo; Rows grow sideways as new measurements are added, tables grow downwards as new series are added, and columns are timestamps. Thus, tables are sparse matrices. Expressions must operate in aggregates over rectangular sections of the sparse matrix, not just rows or columns, and the language must permit a GROUP BY functionality in both directions. You could say that both rows and columns must be addressable by keys instead of by literal identifiers, and ideally by pattern matching in addition to strict equality and ranges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the language and database should support &lt;em&gt;server-side processing&lt;/em&gt; of at least the following, and probably much more:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expressions such as arithmetic and string operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Aggregate functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resampling into time resolutions different from the storage resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expressions and operators that refer to different series, e.g. to sum series, or divide one by another, and to combine such expressions, e.g. to sum up all series whose identifiers match a pattern, then divide the result by the sum of another group of series.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ordering, ranking, and limiting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to say the above is that the language and database should be designed for analytics, not just for drawing strip charts. Many open-source time-series databases such as RRDTool are far too tightly coupled with their expected use case, and this is a serious limitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There should be an efficient binary protocol that supports bulk inserts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;non-requirements&#34;&gt;Non-Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like a database that does one thing well. I do not think I need any of the following, and I regard them as neutral, or in some cases even as drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access control &amp;mdash; authentication and authorization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to visualize data, draw graphs, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for multiple measurements at the same timestamp. The measurement&amp;rsquo;s primary key is &lt;code&gt;series,timestamp&lt;/code&gt; and it does not make sense to allow multiple values with the same timestamp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-dimensionality. Multiple dimensions for a series can be stored as multiple series, and multiple series can be combined in expressions with the query language I specified, so the atom of &amp;ldquo;series&amp;rdquo; already provides for the use case of multi-dimensionality.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Tagging&amp;rdquo; measurements or series with additional ad-hoc key-value pairs. (&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: I now see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/10/16/time-series-tagging/&#34;&gt;the use case for tagging&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Joins from time-series data to relational data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;bonus-and-additional-features&#34;&gt;Bonus and Additional Features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preceding sections describe a good general-purpose time-series database, from my point of view. Nice-to-have features might include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for retention policies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for storing data in multiple resolutions (materialized views) and selecting the appropriate resolution to access for a given request.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for maintaining downsampled data in coarser resolutions, automatically building these materialized views as high-resolution data arrives (automatic rollup).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for query priorities or admission control to prevent starvation and DOS from large queries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my particular uses, I also need support for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many series per server in my cluster, far more than practical limits on the number of files in a directory for example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although some series are long-lived, many are not. Many are sparse, with measurements only once in a long while. Series are dynamic and are not predefined; new series may appear at any moment. Due to this requirement, I need efficient support for discovering which series exist during any given time range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multi-tenancy at the physical level. This is partially by demand; some customers want to know that their data is separate from other customers&amp;rsquo; data. It is partially pragmatic, to support features such as separate retention policies per customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The future of &amp;ldquo;big data&amp;rdquo; is mostly time-series. Someone who creates a good time-series database for
such use cases will probably do quite well. I&amp;rsquo;m sure my requirements aren&amp;rsquo;t the
most general-purpose or complete, but I hope it&amp;rsquo;s useful to share anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Goal</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/05/24/the-goal/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 24 May 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/05/24/the-goal/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time I managed several teams of consultants. At a certain stage of the organization&amp;rsquo;s growth, we wanted to achieve a higher billable-time utilization more easily, and we wanted more structure and process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cary Millsap, about whom I have written quite a bit elsewhere on this blog, suggested that I might profit from reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Eliyahu Goldratt. I will let history be the judge of the outcome, but from my perspective, this was revolutionary for me. It is a clear watershed moment in my memory: I lived life one way and saw things through one lens before, and afterwards everything was different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/05/horse-race.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Horse Race&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt; helped me relate what I had learned about performance in the computer context &amp;mdash; queueing theory, system optimization, computer architecture, and so on &amp;mdash; to organizations. It taught me that, at least in some senses, humans and their interactions form systems that obey fundamentally the same laws as computer components. This is not to dehumanize people and treat them as components. Far from it: &lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt; helped me to organize my thoughts and knowledge about computers by giving me human analogies. It helped me deepen and strengthen my intuition about how things work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will summarize some of the main points of &lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt; in this article, but I encourage you to read the book. It is a parable in the form of a novel, similar in some ways to Daniel Quinn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Ishmael-Adventure-Spirit-Daniel-Quinn/dp/0553375407/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ishmael&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or Dan Millman&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Way-Peaceful-Warrior-Changes-Lives/dp/1932073205/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Way Of The Peaceful Warrior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time I read &lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt;, the consulting group was experiencing tremendous demand, overcommitment to an explosion of inititatives that were too many and varied to execute well, and cash flow challenges. As for myself, I was not only leading the consulting team, but also serving as the main salesperson and an executive at large.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first response to the pressures on the organization was to grow it by hiring quickly.
As a seasoned manager might guess, this amplified many of the problems. In a nutshell, &lt;em&gt;the organization was not scalable&lt;/em&gt; and there was chaos at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/05/chaos.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Chaos&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading &lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt; gave me the first surge of hope I&amp;rsquo;d had in a while. Acting on it solved many problems: some immediately, some long-term. Some things I saw clearly could be improved but was unable to effect the changes I wanted. But the first benefit was hope where I had been hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary-of-the-goal&#34;&gt;Summary of The Goal&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt; introduces the Theory of Constraints, a process of business
improvement. It&amp;rsquo;s a novel about business process optimization, centered around a
factory that&amp;rsquo;s always losing money and missing deadlines.
The manager solves these problems by understanding the true goal of the
factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What did he learn?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of a business is to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;make money by increasing net profit,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;while simultaneously increasing return on investment,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and simultaneously increasing cash flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three are necessary.  To accomplish these, the
business needs to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;increase throughput,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;while simultaneously reducing inventory,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and simultaneously reducing operating expense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These terms have specific meanings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughput: the rate at which the system generates &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt;
 through sales.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inventory: the &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt; the system has invested in
 purchasing things to sell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Operating expense: &lt;em&gt;money&lt;/em&gt; spent to turn inventory into
 throughput.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that all of these are in a common unit, money. Inventory, for example, is not a physical concept, it&amp;rsquo;s monetary. These definitions describe a model of a business as a system of monetary throughput:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;money entering the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;money contained inside the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;money leaving the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Achieving the business&amp;rsquo;s goal requires maximizing the money coming in, minimizing money leaving, and minimizing money that&amp;rsquo;s absorbed into the system. It&amp;rsquo;s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It surprises the manager to learn that his factory&amp;rsquo;s goal is the same as the
business&amp;rsquo;s goal (his factory is a smaller part of a larger business). This is a
general principle: each component&amp;rsquo;s goal is the same as the system&amp;rsquo;s goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a cogent model of a business and its goals in the starkest possible terms, it is necessary to understand what constrains or limits it in each of these dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/05/chain.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Chain&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two primary and strongly related factors, both of which affect business processes: dependencies and variations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dependencies, or dependent events, are things that have to happen before other things can happen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Statistical variations are variations in start times, stop times, or durations of events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variations cause unpredictability, and dependencies cause unpredictability to accumulate and cascade through the system. The only way to keep throughput stable at the process&amp;rsquo;s output is to have excess capacity and buffers in the system. The traditional wisdom of trimming capacity to fit demand (in an attempt to cut waste) will increase the system&amp;rsquo;s unpredictability, drop throughput, and increase inventory. These work against the business&amp;rsquo;s goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is nothing more than queueing theory, but much more simply explained than usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt; introduces a process of continuous improvement towards
the business&amp;rsquo;s goal.  Simplified, it is basically identifying bottlenecks, finding ways to exploit them, prioritizing that, and then looking for the next bottleneck. This is the Theory of Constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;optimizing-the-consulting-teams&#34;&gt;Optimizing The Consulting Teams&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The process of improvement above sounds incredibly obvious, and it is once you see it. After all, I&amp;rsquo;d been doing the same thing in systems performance optimization for years. The magic is in understanding the meaning of constraints, variations, dependencies, throughput, inventory, and so on as it relates to the organization and its processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While studying &lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt; I frequently put the book down and excitedly noted things that had just occurred to me. For example, I created a massive list of constraints. These were always things that had frustrated me, but I&amp;rsquo;d never seen clearly how badly they impacted the organization until I considered them as constraints. To list a few:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timezone differences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsatisfied prerequisites such as access to the systems where work was to be performed, or availability of a consultant with the required skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communication delays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interruptions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transitions between available/unavailable, such as travel or vacation time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were many more, perhaps several dozen. I was on an airplane while doing much of this work, and I remember bursting with excitement. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to start fixing some of the problems that were suddenly so obvious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the clearest problems was that I was a huge constraint myself. I was dependent on many things in the business, and I made a lot of the business dependent on me in turn. For example, I would dedicate myself full-time to consulting when there was too much demand, and when demand slacked, I would stop working with customers and make sales calls. The result is ridiculously obvious in hindsight, but while I was in the midst of it, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see how I was causing the entire organization&amp;rsquo;s workload to overcorrect in giant swings of the pendulum, from too much demand to everyone being practically idle. Hiring a salesperson was the key to solving this problem, so that variations in the sales process were eliminated. The operative word there is &amp;ldquo;variations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/05/chain-link.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dependencies&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major theme that jumped out at me was the ways in which the lack of process was causing problems with inbound work, inventory, and throughput. Lack of process caused a lot of variation in work, and lack of knowledge-sharing caused dependencies amongst people, projects, and teams. Lack of process was either at the root of problems, or intimately involved in them. As I recall, I did not identify a single constraint that could not be improved by better and more consistent processes. For readers who are interested in this line of thought, I can suggest the book &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/E-Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The E-Myth Revisited&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Gerber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt; helped me reduce the complexity of a large consulting group and its attendant business processes and pains to simplest possible terms &amp;mdash; things I could understand and relate clearly to myself and to others. The principles and concepts that weave through &lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt; are easy to grasp and easy to work with, but at the same time there&amp;rsquo;s little danger of over-simplification.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, &lt;em&gt;The Goal&lt;/em&gt; contributed directly to the thought processes that led to my founding VividCortex, and to crucial breakthroughs such as defining a &lt;a href=&#34;https://vividcortex.com/blog/2014/04/24/fault-anomaly-detection/&#34;&gt;system fault&lt;/a&gt; in terms of throughput, inventory, and operating expense. You can read more about this in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://vividcortex.com/blog/2014/04/21/monitoring-is-dead-long-live-performance-management/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; explaining how and why VividCortex is different from a monitoring system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve met very few people who do. Most people pick some notes, crank the tuners,
play some chords, and endlessly fidget back and forth until they either get
something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sound awful to their ears, or they give up. I can&amp;rsquo;t
recall ever seeing a professional musician look like a tuning pro on stage,
either. This really ought to be embarrassing to someone who makes music for a
career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a secret to tuning an instrument. Very few people seem to know it. It&amp;rsquo;s
surprisingly simple, it isn&amp;rsquo;t at all what you might expect, and it makes it easy
and quick to tune an instrument &lt;em&gt;accurately&lt;/em&gt; without guesswork. However, even
though it&amp;rsquo;s simple and logical, it is difficult and subtle at first, and
requires training your ear. This is a neurological, physical, and mental process
that takes some time and practice. It does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; require &amp;ldquo;perfect pitch,&amp;rdquo;
however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how it works. There&amp;rsquo;s a surprising amount of
depth to it, which appeals to the nerd in me. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for &amp;ldquo;the short
version,&amp;rdquo; you won&amp;rsquo;t find it here, because I find the math, physics, and theory
of tuning to be fascinating, and I want to share that and not just the quick
how-to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you practice and train yourself to hear in the correct way, with a little time you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to tune a guitar by just striking the open strings, without using harmonics or frets. You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to do this quickly, and the result will be a guitar that sounds truly active, alive, energetic, amazing &amp;mdash; much better results than you&amp;rsquo;ll get with a digital tuner. As a bonus, you&amp;rsquo;ll impress all of your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-personal-history-with-tuning&#34;&gt;My Personal History With Tuning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a child my mother hired a piano tuner who practiced the &amp;ldquo;lost art&amp;rdquo; of
tuning entirely by ear. His name was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.genealogybuff.com/va/state/webbbs_config.pl/read/298&#34;&gt;Lee Flory&lt;/a&gt;. He was quite a character;
he&amp;rsquo;d tuned for famous concert pianists all over the world, toured with many of
them, and had endless stories to tell about his involvement with all sorts of
musicians in many genres, including bluegrass and country/western greats. My
mother loved the way the piano sounded when he tuned it. It sang. It was alive.
It was joyous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For whatever reason, Lee took an interest in me, and not only tolerated but
encouraged my fascination with tuning. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think about it at the time, but
I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure he scheduled his visits differently to our house. I think he
allowed extra time so that he could spend an hour or more explaining everything
to me, playing notes, coaching me to hear subtleties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus my love affair with the math, physics, and practice of tuning began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;beats&#34;&gt;Beats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first great secret is that tuning isn&amp;rsquo;t about listening to the pitch of
notes. While tuning, you don&amp;rsquo;t try to judge whether a note is too high or too
low. You listen to something called &lt;em&gt;beats&lt;/em&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beats are fluctuations in volume created by two notes that are almost the same
frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When notes are not quite the same frequency, they&amp;rsquo;ll reinforce each other when
the peaks occur together, and cancel each other out when the peaks are
misaligned. Here&amp;rsquo;s a diagram of two sine waves of slightly different
frequencies, and the sum of the two (in red).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/beats.png&#34; alt=&#34;Beats&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your ear will not hear two distinct notes if they&amp;rsquo;re close together. It&amp;rsquo;ll hear
the sum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice how the summed wave (the red wave) fluctuates in magnitude.
To the human ear, this sounds like a note going &amp;ldquo;wow, wow, wow, wow.&amp;rdquo; The frequency of this fluctuation is the difference between the frequencies of the notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what that looks like when you take a mistuned instrument and analyze its FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). This is a G chord played on a harp. The upper G is not perfectly tuned and its amplitude fluctuates because of beats against the lower G.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/fft-beats.png&#34; alt=&#34;Beats FFT&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the foundation of all tuning by ear that isn&amp;rsquo;t based on guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before you go on, tune two strings close together on your guitar or other
instrument, and listen until you can hear it. Or, just fret one string so it
plays the same note as an open string, and strike them together. Bend the string
you&amp;rsquo;ve fretted, a little less, a little more. Listen until you hear the beats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/bending.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Bending String&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-math-of-pitch&#34;&gt;The Math of Pitch&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musical notes have mathematical relationships to one another. The exact
relationships depend on the tuning. There are many tunings, but in this article
I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on the tuning used for nearly all music in modern Western cultures:
the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament&#34;&gt;12-tone equal temperament&lt;/a&gt; tuning, said to be developed by Bach (this is
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.larips.com&#34;&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt;, though).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this tuning, the octave is the fundamental interval of pitch. Notes double in
frequency as they rise an octave, and the ratio of frequencies between each
adjacent pair of notes is constant. Since there are twelve half-steps in an
octave, the frequency increase from one note to the next is the twelfth root of
2, or about 1.059463094359293.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staying with Western music, where we define the A above middle C to have the
frequency of 440Hz, the scale from A220 to A440 is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Note     Frequency
=======  =========
A220     220.0000
A-sharp  233.0819
B        246.9417
C        261.6256
C-sharp  277.1826
D        293.6648
D-sharp  311.1270
E        329.6276
F        349.2282
F-sharp  369.9944
G        391.9954
G-sharp  415.3047
A440     440.0000
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll refer back to this later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-math-of-intervals&#34;&gt;The Math Of Intervals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever sung in harmony or played a chord, you&amp;rsquo;ve used intervals.
Intervals are named for the relative distance between two notes: a minor third,
a fifth, and so on.  These are a little confusing, because they sound like
fractions. They&amp;rsquo;re not. A fifth doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that one note is five times the
frequency of another. A fifth means that if you start on the first note and
count upwards five notes on a major scale, you&amp;rsquo;ll reach the second note in the
interval. Here&amp;rsquo;s the C scale, with the intervals between the lowest C and the
given note listed at the right:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Note  Name  Interval from C
====  ====  ===============
C     Do    Unison
D     Re    Major 2nd
E     Mi    Major 3rd
F     Fa    4th (sometimes called Perfect 4th)
G     So    5th (a.k.a. Perfect 5th)
A     La    Major 6th
B     Ti    Major 7th
C     Do    Octave (8th)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the guitar, adjacent strings form intervals of fourths, except for the
interval between the G and B strings, which is a major third.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some intervals sound &amp;ldquo;good,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;pure,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;harmonious.&amp;rdquo; A major chord, for example, is
composed of the root (first note), major third, fifth, and octave. The chord
sounds good because the intervals between the notes sound good. There&amp;rsquo;s a
variety of intervals at play: between the third and fifth is a minor third,
between the fifth and octave is a fourth, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that the intervals that sound the most pure and harmonious are the ones whose
frequencies have the simplest relationships. In order of increasing complexity,
we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unison: two notes of the same frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Octave: the higher note is double the frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fifth: the higher note is 3/2s the frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fourth: the higher note is 4/3rds the frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Third: the higher note is 5/4ths the frequency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further intervals (minor thirds, sixths, etc) have various relationships, but
the pattern of N/(N-1) doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold beyond the third.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These relationships are important for tuning, but beyond here it gets
significantly more complex. This is where things are most interesting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;overtones-and-intervals&#34;&gt;Overtones and Intervals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a guitar player, you no doubt know about &amp;ldquo;harmonics,&amp;rdquo; also called overtones.
You produce a harmonic by touching a string gently at a specific place (above
the 5th, 7th, or 12th fret, for example) and plucking the string. The note that
results sounds pure, and is higher pitched than the open string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/harmonic.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Harmonics&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strings vibrate at a base frequency, but these harmonics (they&amp;rsquo;re actually
partials, but I&amp;rsquo;ll cover that later) are always present. In fact, much of the
sound energy of a stringed instrument is in overtones, not in the fundamental
frequency. When you &amp;ldquo;play a harmonic&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;re really just damping out most of the
frequencies and putting more energy into simpler multiples of the fundamental
frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overtones are basically multiples of the fundamental frequency. The octave, for
example, is twice the frequency of the open string. Touching the string at the
12th fret is touching it at its halfway point. This essentially divides the
string into two strings of half the length. The frequency of the note is
inversely dependent on the string&amp;rsquo;s length, so half the length makes a note
that&amp;rsquo;s twice the frequency. The seventh fret is at 1/3rd the length of the
string, so the note is three times the frequency; the 5th fret is 1/4th the
length, so you hear a note two octaves higher, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overtones give the instrument its characteristic sound. How many of them
there are, their frequencies, their volumes, and their attack and decay
determines how the instrument sounds. There are usually many overtones, all
mixing together into what you usually think of as a single note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuning depends on overtones, because you can tune an interval by listening to
the beats in its overtones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a fifth, for example. Recall from before that the second note in the fifth
is &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the frequency of the first. Let&amp;rsquo;s use A220 as an example; a fifth up from
A220 is E330.  E330 times two is E660, and A220 times three is E660 also. So by
listening to the first overtone of the E, and the second overtone of the A, you
can &amp;ldquo;hear a fifth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re not really hearing the fifth, of course; you&amp;rsquo;re really hearing the beats
in the overtones of the two notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;practice-hearing-intervals&#34;&gt;Practice Hearing Intervals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practice hearing the overtones in intervals.  Pick up your guitar and de-tune the lowest E string down
to a D. Practice hearing its overtones. Pluck a harmonic at the 12th string and
strike your open D string; listen to the beats between the notes. Now play both
strings open, with no harmonics, at the same time. Listen again to the
overtones, and practice hearing the beats between them. De-tune slightly if you
need to, to make the &amp;ldquo;wow, wow, wow, wow&amp;rdquo; effect easier to notice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take a break; don&amp;rsquo;t overdo it. Your ear will probably fatigue quickly and you&amp;rsquo;ll
be unable to hear the overtones, especially as you experiment more with complex
intervals. In the beginning, you should not be surprised if you can focus on
these overtones for only a few minutes before it gets hard to pick them out and
things sound jumbled together. Rest for a few hours. I would not suggest doing
this more than a couple of times a day initially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fatigue is real, by the way. As I mentioned previously, being able to
hear beats and ignore the richness of the sound to pick out weak overtones is
a complex physical, mental, and neurological skill &amp;mdash; and there
are probably other factors too. I&amp;rsquo;d be interested in seeing brain scans of an
accomplished tuner at work. Lee Flory was not young, and he told me that his
audiologist said his hearing had not decayed with age. This surprised the
doctor, because he spent his life listening to loud sounds. Lee attributed this
to daily training of his hearing, and told me that the ear is like any other
part of the body: it can be exercised. According to Lee, if he took even a
single day&amp;rsquo;s break from tuning, his ear lost some of its acuity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the topic: When you&amp;rsquo;re ready, pluck a harmonic on the lowest D string
(formerly the E string) at the 7th fret, and the A string at the 12th fret, and
listen to the beats between them. Again, practice hearing the same overtones
(ignoring the base notes) when you strike both open strings at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;ve heard this, you can move on to a 4th. You can strike the harmonic at
the 5th fret of the A string and th 7th fret of the D string, for example, and
listen to the beats; then practice hearing the same frequencies by just
strumming those two open strings together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/4542297929_49286da35a.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Soundhole&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you do all of these exercises, try your best to ignore pitch (highness or lowness)
of the notes, and listen only to the fluctuations in volume. In reality you&amp;rsquo;ll be conscious of both pitch and beats, but this practice will help develop your tuning ear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;imperfect-intervals-and-counting-beats&#34;&gt;Imperfect Intervals and Counting Beats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have noticed that intervals in the equal-tempered 12-tone tuning don&amp;rsquo;t
have exactly the simple relationships I listed before. If you look at the table
of frequencies above, for example, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that in steps of the 12th root of
2, E has a frequency of 329.6276Hz, not 330Hz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh no! Was it all a lie? Without these relationships, does tuning fall apart?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/8087829115_b2da0e4435.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Nautilus&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really. In the equal-tempered tuning, in fact, &lt;strong&gt;there is only one perfect
interval: the octave&lt;/strong&gt;. All other intervals are imperfect, or &amp;ldquo;tempered.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 5th is a little &amp;ldquo;narrow&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the higher note in the interval is slightly
flat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The 4th is a little &amp;ldquo;wide&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; the higher note is sharp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The major 3rd is even wider than the 4th&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other intervals are wide or narrow, just depending on where their frequencies fall
on the equal-tempered tuning. (In practice, you will rarely or never tune
intervals other than octaves, 5ths, 4ths, and 3rds.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the pitch of the interval rises, so does the frequency of the beats. The 4th
between A110 and the D above it will beat half as fast as the 4th an octave
higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means is that not only do you need to hear beats, but you need to
&lt;em&gt;count&lt;/em&gt; them. Counting is done in beats per second. It sounds insanely hard at
first (how the heck can you count 7.75 beats a second!?) but it will
come with practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will need to know how many beats wide or narrow a given interval will be.
You can calculate it easily enough, and I&amp;rsquo;ll show examples later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a while of tuning a given instrument, you&amp;rsquo;ll just memorize how many beats
to count for specific intervals, because as you&amp;rsquo;ll see, there&amp;rsquo;s a system for
tuning any instrument. You generally don&amp;rsquo;t need to have every arbitrary
interval memorized. You will use only a handful of intervals and you&amp;rsquo;ll learn
their beats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-are-intervals-imperfect&#34;&gt;Why Are Intervals Imperfect?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s probably some fascinating number theory behind the relationships amongst
intervals, but what I find remarkable is that there are any octave-based scales
that have close-to-perfect intervals at all. It seems to me that it&amp;rsquo;s an
interesting coincidence and nothing more. Look at it this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Octave-based scales are based on powers of two&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intervals are based on powers of something other than two&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are subdivisions of the octave-based scales that coincide nearly, but
not exactly, with the non-power-of-two intervals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t that cool? How unlikely is that?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I vaguely remember reading once when I was a child about an avant-garde composer
who created a scale with something like 51 divisions, which had nearly perfect
intervals and very small gradations between adjacent notes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, powers of two are easy to compute: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256.
Those are the multiples of frequencies. How do those multiples compare versus
the next-simplest interval, the fifth? A fifth is a 3:2 relationship, and there
are 12 fifths&amp;mdash;the &amp;ldquo;cycle of fifths&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;in the evenly tempered scale. If you
keep increasing by fifths you&amp;rsquo;ll end up at the same note after 12 iterations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That means the frequency is 1.5 to the 12th power, right? What is that multiple?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;1.5^12 = 129.74633789
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s pretty close to 128, but slightly &amp;ldquo;wide,&amp;rdquo; meaning if you tune perfect
fifths 12 times in a row you&amp;rsquo;ll end up overshooting, with a frequency that&amp;rsquo;s
1.36% too high. What&amp;rsquo;s the relationship between 3:2 and the 12th root of 2 to
the 7th power (there are 7 semitones in a 5th)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;3/2      = 1.5          # perfect fifth
2^(7/12) = 1.498307077  # fifth as tuned in equal temperaments
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single (perfect) fifth is 0.1129% too high in frequency. Multiply that by 12
and 12 perfect fifths will become 1.36% too high in frequency. Boom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about fourths? They&amp;rsquo;re just the complement of fifths. Thirds? A perfect
major third is a 5:4 frequency ratio. Unlike fifths, the cycle of thirds returns
to the same note after only three steps (for example, C - E - G# - C), so the
number of steps to multiply is different. What is 5/4ths to the 3rd power?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(5/4)^3 = 1.953125
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Close, but not exactly, 2; it&amp;rsquo;s only 97.65625% of a perfect octave. What&amp;rsquo;s the
relationship between 5/4ths and the 12th root of 2 to the 4th power?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;5/4      = 1.25
2^(4/12) = 1.25992105
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single (perfect) major third is too low in frequency; it&amp;rsquo;s only 99.2% of the
frequency it needs to be to align with the evenly tempered scale. If you cube
that, you get 97.65625% again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that explains how fifths and thirds are close to, but not exactly,
perfectly coincident with the frequencies. Again, I think a mathematician who
likes to think in base 2, base 1/12th, base 1.5 and base 1.25 would have fun
with this. Or maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just overthinking it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuning-the-guitar&#34;&gt;Tuning The Guitar&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all that theory behind us, we can move on to a tuning system for the guitar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s list the strings, their frequencies, and some of their overtones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
String  Freq    Overtone_2  Overtone_3  Overtone_4  Overtone_5
======  ======  ======      ======      =======     =======
E       82.41   164.81      247.22      329.63      412.03
A       110.00  220.00      330.00      440.00      550.00
D       146.83  293.66      440.50      587.33      734.16
G       196.00  392.00      587.99      783.99      979.99
B       246.94  493.88      740.82      987.77      1234.71
E       329.63  659.26      988.88      1318.51     1648.14
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the open strings of the guitar form 4ths and one 3rd, you can tune the guitar&amp;rsquo;s strings open, without any frets, using just those intervals. There&amp;rsquo;s also a double octave from the lowest E to the highest E, but you don&amp;rsquo;t strictly need to use that except as a check after you&amp;rsquo;re done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For convenience, here&amp;rsquo;s the same table with only the overtones we&amp;rsquo;ll use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
String  Freq    Overtone_2  Overtone_3  Overtone_4  Overtone_5
======  ======  ==========  ==========  ==========  ==========

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;tuning-the-a-string&#34;&gt;Tuning the A String&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do is tune one of the strings to a reference pitch. After that, you&amp;rsquo;ll tune all of the other strings relative to this first one. On the guitar, the most convenient reference pitch is A440, because the open A string is two octaves below at 110Hz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need a good-quality &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Wittner-Tuning-Fork-In-A-440/dp/B001T21J80/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;A440 tuning fork&lt;/a&gt;. I prefer a Wittner for guitar tuning; it&amp;rsquo;s a good-quality German brand that is compact, so it fits in your guitar case&amp;rsquo;s pocket, and has a small notch behind the ball at the end of the stem, so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to hold in your teeth if you prefer that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/wittner-tuning-fork.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Wittner A440 Tuning Fork&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strike the tuning fork lightly with your fingernail, or tap it gently against your knee. Don&amp;rsquo;t bang it against anything hard or squeeze the tines, or you might damage it and change its pitch. You can hold the tuning fork against the guitar&amp;rsquo;s soundboard, or let it rest lightly between your teeth so the sound travels through your skull to your ears, and strike the open A string. Tune the A string until the beats disappear completely. Now put away the tuning fork and continue. You won&amp;rsquo;t adjust the A string after this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have a tuning fork, you can use any other reference pitch, such as the A on a piano, or a digitally produced A440.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;tuning-the-low-e-string&#34;&gt;Tuning the Low E String&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strike the open low E and A strings together, and tune the E string. Listen to the beating of the overtones at the frequency of the E two octaves higher. If you have trouble hearing it, silence all the strings, then pluck a harmonic on the E string at the 5th fret. Keep that tone in your memory and then sound the two strings together. It&amp;rsquo;s important to play the notes &lt;em&gt;together, open, simultaneously&lt;/em&gt; so that you don&amp;rsquo;t get confused by pitches. Remember, you&amp;rsquo;re trying to ignore pitch completely, and get your ear to isolate the sound of the overtone, ignoring everything but its beating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When correctly tuned, the A string&amp;rsquo;s overtone will be at 330Hz and the E string&amp;rsquo;s will be at 329.63Hz, so the interval is &lt;strong&gt;1/3rd of a beat per second wide&lt;/strong&gt;. That is, you can tune the E string until the beats disappear, and then &lt;strong&gt;flatten the low E string very slightly&lt;/strong&gt; until you hear one beat every three seconds. The result will be a very slow &amp;ldquo;wwwoooooowww, wwwwoooooowww&amp;rdquo; beating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;tuning-the-d-string&#34;&gt;Tuning the D String&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the low E and A strings are tuned, strike the open A and D strings together. You&amp;rsquo;re listening for beats in the high A440 overtone. The A string&amp;rsquo;s overtone will be at 440Hz, and the D string&amp;rsquo;s will be at 440.50Hz, so the interval should be &lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; beat wide.&lt;/strong&gt; Tune the D string until the beats disappear, then &lt;strong&gt;sharpen the D string slightly&lt;/strong&gt; until you hear one beat every 2 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;tuning-the-g-string&#34;&gt;Tuning the G String&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continue by striking the open D and G strings, and listen for the high D overtone&amp;rsquo;s beating. Again, if you have trouble &amp;ldquo;finding the note&amp;rdquo; with your ear, silence everything and strike the D string&amp;rsquo;s harmonic at the 5th fret. You&amp;rsquo;re listening for a high D overtone, two octaves higher than the open D string. The overtones will be at 587.33Hz and 587.99Hz, so the interval needs to be &lt;strong&gt;2/3rds of a beat wide.&lt;/strong&gt; Counting two beats every three seconds is a little harder than the other intervals we&amp;rsquo;ve used thus far, but it will come with practice. In the beginning, feel free to just give it your best wild guess. As we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss a little later, striving for perfection is futile anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;tuning-the-b-string&#34;&gt;Tuning the B String&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strike the open G and B strings. The interval between them is a major 3rd, so this one is trickier to hear. A major 3rd&amp;rsquo;s frequency ratio is approximately 5/4ths, so you&amp;rsquo;re listening for the 5th overtone of the G string and the 4th overtone of the B string. Because these are higher overtones, they&amp;rsquo;re not as loud as the ones you&amp;rsquo;ve been using thus far, and it&amp;rsquo;s harder to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To isolate the note you need to hear, mute all the strings and then pluck a harmonic on the B string at the 5th fret. The overtone is a B two octaves higher. Search around on the G string near the 4th fret and you&amp;rsquo;ll find the same note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overtones are 979.99Hz and 987.77Hz, so the interval is &lt;strong&gt;seven and three-quarters beats wide.&lt;/strong&gt; This will be tough to count at first, so just aim for something about 8 beats and call it good enough. With time you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to actually count this, but it will be very helpful at first to use some rules of thumb. For example, you can compare the rhythm of the beating to the syllables in the word &amp;ldquo;mississippi&amp;rdquo; spoken twice per second, which is probably about as fast as you can say it back-to-back without pause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tune the B string until the beats disappear, then &lt;strong&gt;sharpen it 8 beats, more or less&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;tuning-the-high-e-string&#34;&gt;Tuning the High E String&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re almost done! Strike the open B and E strings, and listen for the same overtone you just used to tune the G and B strings: a high B. The frequencies are 987.77Hz and 988.88Hz, so the interval is &lt;strong&gt;1.1 beats wide.&lt;/strong&gt; Sharpen the E string until the high B note beats a little more than once a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;testing-the-results&#34;&gt;Testing The Results&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run a couple of quick checks to see whether you got things right. First, check your high E against your low E. They are two octaves apart, so listen to the beating of the high E string. It should be very slow or nonexistent. If there&amp;rsquo;s a little beating, don&amp;rsquo;t worry about it. You&amp;rsquo;ll get better with time, and it&amp;rsquo;ll never be perfect anyway, for reasons we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also check the low E against the open B string, and listen for beating at the B note, which is the 3rd overtone of the E string. The B should be very slightly narrow (flat) &amp;mdash; theoretically, you should hear about 1/4th of a beat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also theoretically, you could tune the high B and E strings against the low open E using the same overtones. However, due to imperfections in strings and the slowness of the beating, this is usually much harder to do. As a result, you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with high strings that don&amp;rsquo;t sound good together. A general rule of thumb is that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to hear out-of-tune-ness in notes that are a) closer in pitch and b) higher pitched, so you should generally &amp;ldquo;tune locally&amp;rdquo; rather than &amp;ldquo;tuning at a distance.&amp;rdquo; If you don&amp;rsquo;t get the high strings tuned well together, you&amp;rsquo;ll get really ugly-sounding intervals such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the 5th between your open G string and the D on the 3rd fret of the B string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the 5th between the A on the second fret of the G string and the open high E string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the octave between your open G string and the G on the 3rd fret of the high E string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the octave between your open D string and the D on the 3rd fret of the B string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the 5th between the E on the second fret of the D string and the open B string&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If those intervals are messed up, things will sound badly discordant. Remember that the 5ths &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be slightly narrow, not perfect. But the octaves should be perfect, or very nearly so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Play a few quick chords to test the results, too. An E Major, G major, and B minor are favorites of mine. They have combinations of open and fretted notes that helps make it obvious if anything&amp;rsquo;s a little skewed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/31859506_7e481da3e7.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Chord&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;you-re-done&#34;&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re Done!&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With time, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to run through this tuning system very quickly, and you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with a guitar that sounds joyously alive in all keys, no matter what chord you play. No more fussing with &amp;ldquo;this chord sounds good, but that one is awful!&amp;rdquo; No more trial and error. No more guessing which string is out of tune when something sounds bad. No more game of &amp;ldquo;tuning whack-a-mole.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To summarize:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tune the A string with a tuning fork.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tune the low E string &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of a beat wide relative to the A.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tune the D string &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of a beat wide relative to the A.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tune the G string &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of a beat wide relative to the D.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tune the B string 7 &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; beats wide relative to the G.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tune the high E string just over 1 beat wide relative to the B.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-check the low and high E strings, and play a few chords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can be done in a few seconds per string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you compare your results to what you&amp;rsquo;ll get from a digital tuner, you&amp;rsquo;ll find
that with practice, your ear is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; better. It&amp;rsquo;s very hard to tune within a
Hz or so with a digital tuner, in part because the indicators are hard to read.
What you&amp;rsquo;ll get with a digital tuner is most strings are pretty close to their
correct frequency. This is a lot better than the ad-hoc tuning by
trial-and-error you might have been accustomed to doing, because that method
results in some intervals being tuned to sound good but others badly discordant.
The usual scenario I see is someone&amp;rsquo;s B string is in good shape, but the G and
the E are out of tune. The guitar player then tunes the B string relative to the
out-of-tune E and G, and then everything sounds awful. This is because the
guitarist had no frame of reference for understanding which strings were out of
tune in which directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when you tune by listening to beats, and get good at it, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to
tune strings to within a fraction of a cycle per second of what they should be.
Your results will absolutely be better than a digital tuner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t mean to dismiss digital tuners. They&amp;rsquo;re very useful when you&amp;rsquo;re in a
noisy place, or when you&amp;rsquo;re tuning things like electric guitars, which have
distortion that buries overtones in noise. But if you learn to tune by
hearing beats, you&amp;rsquo;ll be the better for it, and you&amp;rsquo;ll never regret it, I
promise. By the way, if you have an Android smartphone, I&amp;rsquo;ve had pretty good
results with the gStrings app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/tune-o-phone.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tune-o-phone&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;advanced-magic&#34;&gt;Advanced Magic&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do the math on higher overtones, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice a few other interesting intervals between open strings. As your ear sharpens, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to hear these, and use them to cross-check various combinations of strings. This can be useful because as you get better at hearing overtones and beats, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably start to become a bit of a perfectionist, and you won&amp;rsquo;t be happy unless particular intervals (such as the 5ths and octaves mentioned just above) sound good. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open A String to Open B String.&lt;/strong&gt; The 9th overtone of the open A string is a high B note at 990Hz, and the 4th overtone of the open B is a high B at 987.77HZ. If you can hear this high note, you should hear it beating just over twice per second. The interval between the A and B strings is a minor 7th, which should be slightly narrow. Thus, if you tune the B until the beating disappears, you should then flatten it two beats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open D String to Open E String.&lt;/strong&gt; This is also a minor 7th interval. You&amp;rsquo;re listening for a very high E note, at 1321.5Hz on the D string, and 1318.5 on the E string, which is 3 beats narrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open D String to Open B String.&lt;/strong&gt; The 5th overtone of the D string is similar to the 3rd overtone of the B string. This interval is about 6 and &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; beats wide. This is a bit hard to hear at first, but you&amp;rsquo;re listening for a high F-sharp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;systems-for-tuning-arbitrary-instruments&#34;&gt;Systems for Tuning Arbitrary Instruments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guitar is a fairly simple instrument to tune, because it has only 6 strings,
and 4ths are an easy interval to tune. The inclusion of a major 3rd makes it a
little harder, but not much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is more complicated, and requires more practice, to tune instruments with
more strings. The most general approach is to choose an octave, and to tune all the
notes within it. Then you extend the tuning up and down the range as needed.
For example, to tune the piano you first tune all the notes within a C-to-C
octave (piano tuners typically use a large middle-C tuning fork).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your first octave tuned, the rest is simple. Each
note is tuned to the octave below it or above it. But getting that first octave
is a bit tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two very common systems of tuning: fourths and fifths, and thirds and
fifths. As you may know, the cycle of fifths will cycle you through every note
in the 12-note scale. You can cycle through the notes in various ways, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fun tangent: this &lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jotFAQAAMAAJ&#34;&gt;old book from 1821
explains&lt;/a&gt;, in a
roundabout way, the system of fifths and thirds as well as a system based on
advancing by major and minor thirds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/old-tuning-book.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tuning&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system of thirds and fifths proceeds from middle C up a fifth to G, down a
third to E-flat, up a fifth to B-flat, and so on.  The system of fourths and
fifths goes from C up a fifth to G, down a fourth to D, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need to do is calculate the beats in the various intervals and be able
to count them. The piano tuners I&amp;rsquo;ve known prefer thirds and fifths because if
there are imperfections in the thirds, especially if they&amp;rsquo;re not as wide as they
should be, it sounds truly awful. Lively-sounding thirds are important; fourths
and fifths are nearly perfect, and should sound quite pure, but a third is a
complex interval with a lot of different things going on. Fourths and fifths
also beat slowly enough that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to misjudge and get an error that
accumulates as you go through the 12 notes. Checking the tuning with thirds
helps avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuning-a-hammered-dulcimer&#34;&gt;Tuning a Hammered Dulcimer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve built several many-stringed instruments, including a couple of hammered
dulcimers. My first was a home woodworking project with some two-by-four lumber,
based on plans from a book by Phillip Mason I found at the library and decided
to pick up on a whim. For a homebuilt instrument, it sounded great, and building
an instrument like this is something I highly recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later I designed and built a second one, pictured below. Pardon the dust!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/dulcimer.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Dulcimer&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuning this dulcimer takes a while. I start with an octave on the bass course.
Dulcimers can have many different tunings; this
one follows the typical tuning of traditional dulcimers, which is essentially a
set of changing keys that cycle backwards by fifths as you climb the scale.
Starting at G, for example, you have a C major scale up to the next G, centered
around middle C. But the next B is B-flat instead of B-natural, so there&amp;rsquo;s an F
major scale overlapping with the top of the C major, and so on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;G A B C D E F G A B-flat C D...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to tune this instrument in fourths and fifths because of the way its
scales are laid out. If I do that, however, I find that I have ugly-sounding
thirds more often than not. So I&amp;rsquo;ll tune by combinations of fifths, fourths, and
thirds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
G A B C D E F G A B-flat C D...
^-------------^                 (up an octave)
      ^-------^                 (down a fifth)
      ^---^                     (up a third)
  ^-------^                     (down a fifth)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so on. In addition to using thirds where I can (G-B, C-E), I&amp;rsquo;ll check my
fifths and fourths against each other. If you do the math, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that
the fourth from G to C is exactly as wide as the fifth from C to G again is
narrow. (This is a general rule of fourths and fifths. Another rule is that the
fourth at the top of the octave beats twice as fast as the fifth at the bottom;
so G-D beats half as fast as D-G.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m done with this reference octave, I&amp;rsquo;ll extend it up the entire bass
course, adjusting for B-flat by tuning it relative to F, and checking any new
thirds that I encounter as I climb the scale. And then I&amp;rsquo;ll extend that over to
the right-hand side of the treble course. I do not use the left-hand (high) side
of the treble course to tune, because its notes are inaccurate depending on the
placement of the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a little math (spreadsheets are nice), and some practice, you can find a
quick way to tune almost any instrument, along with cross-checks to help prevent
skew as you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;tuning-a-harp&#34;&gt;Tuning a Harp&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another instrument I built (this time with my grandfather) is a simplified
replica of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Mary_Harp&#34;&gt;Scottish wire-strung Queen Mary harp&lt;/a&gt;. This historical
instrument might have been designed for some golden and silver strings,
according to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.annheymann.com/gold.htm&#34;&gt;Ann Heyman&amp;rsquo;s research&lt;/a&gt;. In any case, it is quite difficult to
tune with bronze or brass strings.  It is &amp;ldquo;low-headed&amp;rdquo; and would need a much
higher head to work well with bronze or brass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/harp.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Harp&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tuning this harp is quite similar to the hammered dulcimer, although it is in a
single key, so there&amp;rsquo;s no need to adjust to key changes as you climb the scale.
A simple reference octave is all you need, and then it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of
extending it. I have never tuned a concert harp, but I imagine it&amp;rsquo;s more
involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tangent: I first discovered the wire-strung harp in 1988, when I heard Patrick
Ball&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Celtic-Harp-Vol-Turlough-OCarolan/dp/B0000007SD/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;first volume&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turlough_O&#39;Carolan&#34;&gt;Turlough O&amp;rsquo;Carolan&amp;rsquo;s music&lt;/a&gt;. If you have not
listened to these recordings, do yourself a favor and at least preview them on
Amazon. All these years later, I still listen to Patrick Ball&amp;rsquo;s music often.
His newest recording, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Wood-Morois-Patrick-Ball/dp/B004FA20T0/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;The Wood of Morois&lt;/a&gt;, is just stunning.
I corresponded with Patrick while planning to build my harp, and he put me in
touch with master harpmaker &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.witcherharps.com/&#34;&gt;Jay Witcher&lt;/a&gt;, and his own role model, Ann
Heymann, who was responsible for reinventing the lost techniques of playing
wire-strung harps. Her recordings are a little hard to find in music stores, but
are worth it. You can buy them from her websites
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.clairseach.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.clairseach.com/&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.annheymann.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.annheymann.com/&lt;/a&gt;, and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.harpofgold.net/&#34;&gt;http://www.harpofgold.net/&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning to play wire-strung
harp, her book is one of the main written sources.
There are a variety of magazines covering the harp renaissance in the latter
part of the 20th century, and they contain much valuable additional material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;systems-for-tuning-diatonic-instruments&#34;&gt;Systems For Tuning Diatonic Instruments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you tune the harp, in practice? Here&amp;rsquo;s how I do it for a harp in C:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use an A440 tuning fork to tune the A3 string. Its frequency is 220Hz but it&amp;rsquo;s
easy to tune by listening to its first partial.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Down a 5th to D; &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; beat narrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return to the A440.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Down a 3rd to F; 7 beats wide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up a 5th to C; .6 beat narrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Down an octave to the lower C; perfect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up a 5th to G; .4 beat narrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up a 3rd to B; 7.75 beats wide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Down a 5th to E; .55 beat narrow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-check between the E and lower C; both already tuned. Should be just over
5 beats wide.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-check all the 4ths and ensure they are neither lifeless nor beating
rapidly. In particular, the interval D-G is quite important, and there are 5
steps in the tuning sequence between these notes, so it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty sensitive
indicator of whether you&amp;rsquo;ve been getting the beats right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand the octave to the rest of the instrument by octaves. At each note, cross-check
against any already-tuned notes and ensure 5ths, 4ths, and 3rds are not
drifting and becoming cat-fights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A diagram might help. The arrows indicate which note to tune from the current
note and in what order. The &amp;lsquo;n&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;w&amp;rsquo; notation indicates how narrow or wide
the intervals should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your diatonic instrument is tuned in the key of G, you can use this sequence
instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/tuning-g-scale.png&#34; alt=&#34;Tuning the Diatonic G Scale&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that in both cases, you are essentially tuning successive major and minor
chords, although when you stay within the confines of a single octave you
sometimes only have an inversion tuned unless you include a note outside the
octave. Of course, you can include more notes, but if you&amp;rsquo;re having a hard time
getting things to sound good together then you probably have some imprecision
(trouble counting beats?) and adding more notes might make it harder for you to
close the loop, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;beyond-tuning-theory-the-real-world&#34;&gt;Beyond Tuning Theory: The Real World&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although simple math can compute the theoretically correct frequencies of notes
and their overtones, and thus the beats of various intervals, in practice a
number of factors make things more complicated and interesting. In fact, the
math up until now has been of the &amp;ldquo;frictionless plane&amp;rdquo; variety. For those who
are interested, I&amp;rsquo;ll dig deeper into these nuances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nuances and deviations from perfect theory are the main reasons why a) it&amp;rsquo;s
impossible to tune anything perfectly and b) an instrument that&amp;rsquo;s tuned
skillfully by ear sounds glorious, whereas an instrument tuned digitally can
sound lifeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(In many cases it&amp;rsquo;s really convenient to use a digital tuner to bring things
pretty close, then go through one of the sequences explained above to
cross-check. This can save a lot of time when an instrument is very out-of-tune
and shifts a lot during tuning, in which case it&amp;rsquo;ll be out again when you&amp;rsquo;re
done. If you need to make multiple passes to bring things close to tune, digital
tuners are great time savers.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;harmonics-overtones-and-partials&#34;&gt;Harmonics, Overtones, and Partials&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was careful to use the term &amp;ldquo;overtone&amp;rdquo; most of the time previously. In theory,
a string vibrates at its fundamental frequency, and then it has harmonic overtones at
twice that frequency, three times, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, that&amp;rsquo;s not what happens in practice, because theory only applies to
strings that have no stiffness. The stiffness of the string causes its overtones
to vibrate at slightly higher frequencies than you&amp;rsquo;d expect. For this reason,
these overtones aren&amp;rsquo;t true harmonics. This is called inharmonicity, and
inharmonic overtones are called &lt;em&gt;partials&lt;/em&gt; to distinguish them from the purely
harmonic overtones of an instrument like a flute, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t exhibit the same
effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might think that this inharmonicity is a bad thing, but it&amp;rsquo;s not.
Common tones with a great deal of inharmonicity are bells (which often have so much inharmonicity that you can hear the pitches of their partials are too high) and various types of chimes. I keep a little &amp;ldquo;zenergy&amp;rdquo; chime near my morning meditation table because its bright tones focus my attention. I haven&amp;rsquo;t analyzed its spectrum, but because it is made with thick bars of aluminum, I&amp;rsquo;m willing to bet that it has partials that are wildly inharmonic. Yet it sounds pure and clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Woodstock-Percussion-ZENERGY3-Zenergy-Instrument/dp/B0000775FZ/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/zenergy.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Woodstock Percussion ZENERGY3 Zenergy Chime&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of the richness and liveliness of a string&amp;rsquo;s sound is precisely because of the
&amp;ldquo;stretched&amp;rdquo; overtones. Many people compare Patrick Ball&amp;rsquo;s brass-strung wire harp to the sound of bells, and say it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;pure.&amp;rdquo; It may sound pure, but pure-sounding is not simple-sounding. Its tones are complex and highly inharmonic, which is why it sounds like a bell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, if you digitally alter a piano&amp;rsquo;s overtones to correct the stretching, you get something that sounds like an organ, not a piano. This is one of the reasons that pianos tuned with digital tuners often sound like something scraped from the bottom of a pond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some digital tuners claim to compensate for inharmonicity, but in reality each instrument and its strings are unique and will be inharmonic in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some practical consequences when tuning by listening to beats:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t listen to higher partials while tuning. When tuning an octave, for example, you should ignore the beating of partials 2 octaves up. This is actually quite difficult to do and requires a well-developed ear. The reason is that higher partials will beat even when the octave is perfect, and they beat more rapidly and more obviously than the octave. Tuning a perfect octave requires the ability to hear very subtle, very gradual beats while blocking out distractions. This is also why I said not to worry if your low E string and high E string beat slightly. When tuned as well as possible, there will probably be a little bit of beating.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might need to ignore higher partials in other intervals as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might need to adjust your tuning for stretching caused by inharmonicity. In practice, for example, most guitars need to be tuned to slightly faster beats than you&amp;rsquo;d expect from pure theory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-checking your results with more complex intervals (especially thirds) can help balance the stretching better, and make a more pleasing-sounding tuning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You might find that when using the &amp;ldquo;advanced tricks&amp;rdquo; I mentioned for the guitar, the open intervals such as minor 7ths will beat at different rates than you&amp;rsquo;d predict mathematically. However, once you are comfortable tuning your guitar so it sounds good, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how fast those intervals should beat and it&amp;rsquo;ll be a great cross-reference for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;sympathetic-and-false-beats&#34;&gt;Sympathetic and False Beats&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s often very helpful to mute strings while you&amp;rsquo;re tuning other strings. The reason is that the strings you&amp;rsquo;re tuning will set up sympathetic vibrations in other strings that have similar overtones, and this can distract you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When tuning the guitar, this generally isn&amp;rsquo;t much of a problem. However, be careful that when you tune the low E and A strings you don&amp;rsquo;t get distracted by vibrations from the high E string.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When tuning other instruments such as a hammered dulcimer or harp, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Rubber-Mutes-Piano-Tuning-Assortment/dp/B006RE74WA/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;small felt or rubber wedges&lt;/a&gt; (with wire handles if possible) are invaluable. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have these, you can use small loops of cloth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to distraction from sympathetic vibrations, strings can beat alone, when no other note is sounding. This is called a false beat. It&amp;rsquo;s usually caused by a flaw in the string itself, such as an imperfection in the wire or a spot of rust. This is a more difficult problem, because you can&amp;rsquo;t just make it go away. Instead, you will often have to nudge the tuning around a little here, a little there, to make it sound the best you can overall, given that there will be spurious beats no matter what. False beats will challenge your ear greatly, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a guitar, false beats might signal that it&amp;rsquo;s time for a new set of strings. In a piano or other instrument, strings can be expensive to replace, and new strings take a while to settle in, so it&amp;rsquo;s often better to just leave it alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;imperfect-frets-strings-bridges-and-nuts&#34;&gt;Imperfect Frets, Strings, Bridges and Nuts&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve never played a guitar with perfect frets. The reality is that every note you fret will be slightly out of tune, and one goal of tuning is to avoid any particular combination of bad intervals that sounds particularly horrible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why it&amp;rsquo;s helpful to play at least a few chords after tuning. If you tune a particular instrument often you&amp;rsquo;ll learn the slight adjustments needed to make things sound as good as possible. On my main guitar, for example, the B string needs to be slightly sharp so that a D sounds better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not only the frets, but the nut (the zeroth fret) and the bridge (under the right hand) that matter. Sometimes the neck needs to be adjusted as well. A competent guitar repairman should be able to adjust the action if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the weight and manufacture of the strings makes a difference. My main guitar and its frets and bridge sound better and more accurate with medium-weight Martin bronze-wound strings than other strings I&amp;rsquo;ve tried. As your ear improves, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice subtleties like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/2516054483_876aa398c5.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fretting&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;new-strings&#34;&gt;New Strings&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New strings (or wires) will take some time to stretch and settle in so they stay in tune. You can shorten this time by playing vigorously and stretching the strings, bending them gently. Be careful, however, not to be rough with the strings. If you kink them or strain them past their elastic point, you&amp;rsquo;ll end up with strings that have false beats, exaggerated inharmonicity, or different densities along some lengths of the string, which will make it seem like your frets are wrong in strange ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-instrument-flexes-and-changes&#34;&gt;The Instrument Flexes and Changes&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an instrument is especially out of tune, the first strings you tune will become slightly out of tune as you change the tension on the rest of the instrument. The best remedy I can offer for this is to do a quick approximate tuning without caring much about accuracy. Follow this up with a second, more careful tuning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was especially a problem with my first hammered dulcimer, and is very noticeable with my harp, which flexes and changes a lot as it is tuned. My second hammered dulcimer has a &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; inch birch plywood back and internal reinforcements, so it&amp;rsquo;s very stable. On the downside, it&amp;rsquo;s heavy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Temperature and humidity play a large role, too. All of the materials in an instrument respond in different ways to changes in temperature and humidity. If you have a piano, you&amp;rsquo;re well advised to keep it in a climate-controlled room. If you&amp;rsquo;re a serious pianist you already know much more than I do about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;friction-and-torque-in-tuning-pin-and-bridges&#34;&gt;Friction and Torque in Tuning Pin and Bridges&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For guitarists, it&amp;rsquo;s important to make sure that your nut (the zeroth fret) doesn&amp;rsquo;t pinch the string and cause it to move in jerks and starts, or to have extra tension built up between the nut and the tuning peg itself. If this happens, you can rub a pencil in the groove where the string rides. The graphite in the pencil is a natural lubricant that can help avoid this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, you should also make sure that your tuning pegs and their machinery are smooth and well lubricated. If there&amp;rsquo;s excessive slop due to wear-and-tear or cheap machinery, that will be an endless source of frustration for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/01/8193104904_2c29a6b372.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tuning Pegs&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On instruments such as pianos, hammered dulcimers, and harps, it&amp;rsquo;s important to know how to &amp;ldquo;set&amp;rdquo; the tuning pin. While tuning the string upwards, you&amp;rsquo;ll create torque on the pin, twisting it in the hole. The wood fibers holding it in place will also be braced in a position that can &amp;ldquo;flip&amp;rdquo; downwards. If you just leave the pin like this, it will soon wiggle itself back to its normal state, and even beyond that due to the tension the wire places on the pin. As a result, you need to practice tuning the note slightly higher than needed, and then de-tuning it, knocking it down to the desired pitch with a light jerk and leaving it in a state of equilibrium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique is also useful in guitars and other stringed instruments, but each type of tuning machine has its own particularities. The main point to remember is that if you don&amp;rsquo;t leave things in a state of equilibrium and stability, they&amp;rsquo;ll find one soon enough, de-tuning the instrument in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;references-and-further-reading&#34;&gt;References and Further Reading&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to find the book from which I studied tuning as a child, but I can&amp;rsquo;t anymore. I thought it was an old Dover edition. The Dover book on tuning that I can find is not the one I remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find a little bit of information at various places online. One site with interesting information is &lt;a href=&#34;http://historicaltuning.com/&#34;&gt;Historical Tuning of Keyboard Instruments&lt;/a&gt; by Robert Chuckrow. I looked around on Wikipedia but didn&amp;rsquo;t find much of use. Please suggest further resources in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I discussed the equally-tempered tuning, but there are many others. The study of them and their math, and the cultures and musical histories related to them, is fascinating. Next time you hear bagpipes, or a non-Western instrument, pay attention to the tuning. Is it tempered? Are there perfect intervals other than the octave? Which ones?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to windchimes is another interesting exercise. Are the chimes harmonic or do they have inharmonicity? What scales and tunings do they use? What are the effects? &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Woodstock-Magical-Mystery-55-Inch-Odyssey/dp/B00BD8EM48/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;Woodstock&lt;/a&gt; chimes use many unique scales and tunings. Many of their chimes combine notes in complex ways that result in no beating between some or all of the tones. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Music-Sphere-Pentatonic-Chime-PB/dp/B0007QS6YO/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;Music of the Spheres&lt;/a&gt; also makes stunning chimes in a variety of &lt;a href=&#34;https://musicofspheres.com/products/music_chart.php&#34;&gt;scales and tunings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned, spreadsheets can be very helpful in computing the relationships between various notes and their overtones. I&amp;rsquo;ve made a small &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqLZaBImC-JLdFp0RnNpY2JPcWlPdnNQXzkyQ2hyb1E&amp;amp;usp=sharing&#34;&gt;online spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; that contains some of the computations I used to produce this blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you suggest any other references or related books, music, or links.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy your beautifully tuned guitar or other instrument, and most of all, enjoy
the process of learning to tune and listen! I hope it enriches your appreciation
and pleasure in listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Not long ago I attended a talk about Datomic, which focused a lot on database
immutability and its benefits. I hope to illustrate why many database designs
are much more complicated than Datomic and its ilk. Although Datomic&amp;rsquo;s design
can be presented as &lt;em&gt;advanced&lt;/em&gt;, there&amp;rsquo;s another side to the story, which also
holds true for similar databases such as CouchDB. It&amp;rsquo;s a really difficult
problem space, and clean and elegant solutions without nasty edge cases are
difficult to design and implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2013/12/uluru.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Uluru&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;datomic-and-immutability&#34;&gt;Datomic and Immutability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From what I can understand as a non-expert, the Datomic-in-a-nutshell is that it uses an append-only B-tree to record data, and never updates any data after it&amp;rsquo;s written. The speaker wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what an append-only B-tree was, but his detailed description matched AOBTs perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this a big deal? Immutable data confers a lot of nice benefits. Here&amp;rsquo;s an incomplete summary:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s more cacheable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easier to reason about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s less likely to get corrupted from bugs and other problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can rewind history and view the state at any point in the past, by using an &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; root for the tree.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backups are simple: just copy the file, no need to take the database offline. In fact, you can do continuous backups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replication is simple and fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crash recovery is simple and fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easier to build a reliable system on unreliable components with immutability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, immutability results in a lot of nice, elegant properties that just feel wonderful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;prior-art&#34;&gt;Prior Art&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datomic is not alone in choosing immutability. I have seen at least two other databases architected similarly. Their creators highlighted many of the same benefits. In fact, if you listened to early talks from the architects of RethinkDB, you could practically search and replace &amp;ldquo;RethinkDB&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;Datomic&amp;rdquo;. The same is true of CouchDB. To list a few links to RethinkDB&amp;rsquo;s history: &lt;a href=&#34;http://techcrunch.com/2009/07/28/yc-funded-rethinkdb-a-mysql-storage-engine-built-from-the-ground-up-for-ssds/&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.bytebot.net/blog/archives/2009/07/28/rethinkdb-all-the-rage-today&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://carcaddar.blogspot.com/2009/10/append-only-databases.html&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That last one links to &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pathelland/archive/2007/06/14/accountants-don-t-use-erasers.aspx&#34;&gt;Accountants Don&amp;rsquo;t Use Erasers,&lt;/a&gt; a blog post that brought append-only storage into the minds of many people at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond databases, don&amp;rsquo;t forget about filesystems, such as ZFS for example. Many of the same design techniques are employed here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to RethinkDB; around 2011 or so, its append-only design wasn&amp;rsquo;t as prominent anymore. What happened?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;append-only-blues&#34;&gt;Append-Only Blues&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immutability can be costly. Later I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how those costs are paid by lots of databases that don&amp;rsquo;t build so heavily around immutability, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first is that space usage grows forever. Logically, people insert facts, and then update the database with new facts. Physically, if what you&amp;rsquo;re doing is just recording newer facts that obsolete old ones, then you end up with outdated rows. It may feel nice to be able to access those old facts, but the reality is most people don&amp;rsquo;t want that, and don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay the cost (infinitely growing storage) for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second is fragmentation. If entities are made of related facts, and some facts are updated but others aren&amp;rsquo;t, then as the database grows and new facts are recorded, an entity ends up being scattered widely over a lot of storage. This gets slow, even on SSDs with fast random access. Solving this can be difficult and introduce lots of complexity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last is that a data structure or algorithm that&amp;rsquo;s elegant and pure, but has one or more worst cases, can fall apart rather violently in real-world usage. That&amp;rsquo;s because real-world usage is often much more diverse than you&amp;rsquo;d suspect. A database that has a &amp;ldquo;tiny worst-case scenario&amp;rdquo; can end up hitting that worst-case behavior for something rather more than a tiny fraction of its users. In my personal experience, it&amp;rsquo;s often a significant &lt;em&gt;majority&lt;/em&gt;. An easy example in a different domain is sort algorithms. Nobody implements straightforward best-performance-most-of-the-time sort algorithms because if they do, things go to hell in a handbasket rather quickly. Databases end up with similar &lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rethinkdb/Bcg1NPTU6do&#34;&gt;hard cases&lt;/a&gt; to handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more challenges, many of them much harder to talk about and understand (dealing with concurrency, for example), but these are the biggest, most obvious ones I&amp;rsquo;ve seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, you can see RethinkDB &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.quora.com/In-the-RethinkDB-paper-one-of-the-references-is-to-An-append-only-index-tree-structure-which-was-supposed-to-appear-in-the-fourth-quarter-of-2009.-Is-this-paper-available-today&#34;&gt;quickly putting append-only, immutable design behind them&lt;/a&gt;. They stopped talking and writing about it. Their whitepaper, &amp;ldquo;Rethinking Database Storage&amp;rdquo;, is gone from their website (rethinkdb.com/papers/whitepaper.pdf) but you can get it from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20090806193803/http://www.rethinkdb.com/papers/whitepaper.pdf&#34;&gt;wayback machine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reality sunk in and they had to move on from elegant theories to the bitterness of solving real-world problems. Whenever you hear about a new database, remember this: &lt;em&gt;this shit is really, really, really hard.&lt;/em&gt; It typically takes many years for a database or storage engine to become production-ready in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update: I can&amp;rsquo;t find the reference anymore, but I think my view of history was
too simplistic; another important aspect of the story is that they just moved on
to other problems once the storage layer matured. I&amp;rsquo;m leaving the above para as
it is and I&amp;rsquo;d like to modify it to say that was my opinion at the time I wrote
this post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog post isn&amp;rsquo;t about RethinkDB, though. I&amp;rsquo;m just using their evolution over time as an example of what happens when theory meets reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-couchdb-problem&#34;&gt;The CouchDB Problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Around the same time as RethinkDB, a new NoSQL database called CouchDB was built on many of the same premises. In fact, I even blogged a quick overview of it as it started to become commercialized: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2010/09/07/a-gentle-introduction-to-couchdb-for-relational-practitioners/&#34;&gt;A gentle introduction to CouchDB for relational practitioners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CouchDB had so many benefits from using immutability. MVCC (multi-version concurrency control), instant backup and recovery, crash-only design. But the big thing everyone complained about was&amp;hellip; &lt;a href=&#34;http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Compaction&#34;&gt;compaction&lt;/a&gt;. CouchDB became a little bit legendary for compaction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, CouchDB&amp;rsquo;s files would grow forever, and you&amp;rsquo;d fill up your disks if you didn&amp;rsquo;t do something about it. What could you do about it? CouchDB&amp;rsquo;s answer was that you would periodically save a complete new database, without old versions of documents that had been obsoleted. It&amp;rsquo;s a rewrite-the-whole-database process. The most obvious problem with this was that you had to reserve twice as much disk space as you needed for your database, because you needed enough space to write a new copy. If your disk got too full, compaction would fail because there wasn&amp;rsquo;t space for two copies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you were writing into your database too fast, compaction would never catch up with the writes. And there were a host of other problems that could potentially happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Datomic seems to have all of these problems too, up to and including stop-the-world blocking of writes (which in my book is complete unavailability of the database).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;acid-mvcc-relational-databases&#34;&gt;ACID MVCC Relational Databases&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a class of database systems that has long been aware of the challenges with the database designs I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned so far. Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL (InnoDB), and PostgreSQL all have arrived at designs that share some properties in common. These characteristics go some ways towards satisfying the needs of general-purpose database storage and retrieval in wide ranges of use cases, with excellent performance under mixed workloads. Depending on your workload, they arguably have relatively few and rare worst-case behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The properties are ACID transactions with multi-version concurrency control (MVCC). The relational aspect is ancillary. You could build these properties in a variety of non-SQL, non-relational databases. It just happens that the databases that have been around longer than most, and are more mature and sophisticated, are mostly relational. That&amp;rsquo;s why these design choices and characteristics show up in relational databases &amp;ndash; no other reason as far as I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multi-version concurrency control lets database users see a consistent state of the database at a point in time, even as the database accepts changes from other users concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is this done? By keeping old versions of rows. These databases operate roughly as follows: when a row is updated, an old version is kept if there&amp;rsquo;s any transaction that still needs to see it. When the old versions aren&amp;rsquo;t needed any more, they&amp;rsquo;re purged. Implementation details and terminology vary. I can speak most directly about InnoDB, which never updates a row in the primary key (which is the table itself). Instead, a new row is written, and the database is made to recognize this as the &amp;ldquo;current&amp;rdquo; state of the world. Old row versions are kept in a history list; access to this is slower than access to the primary key. Thus, the current state of the database is optimized to be the fastest to access.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, about ACID transactions. Managing the write-ahead log and flushing dirty pages to disk is one of the most complex and hardest things an ACID database does, in my opinion. The process of managing the log and dirty pages in memory is called checkpointing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write-ahead logging and ACID, caching, MVCC, and old-version-purge are often intertwined to some extent, for implementation reasons. This is a very complex topic and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Transaction-Processing-Concepts-Techniques-Management/dp/1558601902/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;entire&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Transactional-Information-Systems-Algorithms-Concurrency/dp/1558605088/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; (huge books!) have been written about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s happening in such a database is a combination of &lt;strong&gt;short-term immutability&lt;/strong&gt;, read and write optimizations to save and/or coalesce redundant work, and continuous &amp;ldquo;compaction&amp;rdquo; and reuse of disk space to stabilize disk usage and avoid infinite growth. Doing these things a little bit at a time allows the database to gradually take care of business without needing to stop the world. Unfortunately, this is incredibly hard, and I am unaware of any such database that is completely immune to &amp;ldquo;furious flushing,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;garbage collection pause,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;compaction stall,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;runaway purge,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;VACUUM blocking,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;checkpoint stall,&amp;rdquo; or whatever it tends to be called in your database of choice. There is usually a combination of some kind of workload that can push things over the edge. The most obvious case is if you try to change the database faster than the hardware can physically keep up. Because a lot of this work is done in the background so that it&amp;rsquo;s non-blocking and can be optimized in various ways, most databases will allow you to overwork the background processes if you push foreground activity hard enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show me a database and I&amp;rsquo;ll show you someone complaining about these problems. I&amp;rsquo;ll start out: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2012/09/04/adaptive-flushing-in-mysql-5-6/&#34;&gt;MySQL&amp;rsquo;s adaptive flushing&lt;/a&gt; has been beaten to death by Percona and Oracle engineers. &lt;a href=&#34;http://basho.com/leveldb-in-riak-1-2/&#34;&gt;Riak on LevelDB&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;ldquo;On a test server, LevelDB in 1.1 saw stalls of 10 to 90 seconds every 3 to 5 minutes. In Riak 1.2, levelDB sometimes sees one stall every 2 hours for 10 to 30 seconds.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;http://rhaas.blogspot.com/2011/03/troubleshooting-stuck-vacuums.html&#34;&gt;PostgreSQL&amp;rsquo;s VACUUM can stall out&lt;/a&gt;. I can go on. Every one of those problems is being improved somehow, but also can be triggered if circumstances are right. It&amp;rsquo;s hard (impossible?) to avoid completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;evolution-of-append-only&#34;&gt;Evolution of Append-Only&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one-thing-at-a-time architecture of append-only systems, with periodic rewrites of the whole database, almost inevitably evolves into continuous, concurrent performing of the same tasks. Immutability can&amp;rsquo;t live forever. It&amp;rsquo;s better to do things continuously in the background than to accrue a bunch of debt and then pay it back in one giant blocking operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s how most mature, sophisticated databases with lots of scar tissue end up over time. The result is that Oracle (for example) can sustain combinations of workloads such as very high-frequency small operations reads and writes, together with days-long read-heavy and write-heavy batch processing, simultaneously, and providing good performance for both! That&amp;rsquo;s hard to achieve in a database that can only do one thing at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, keep that in mind if you start to feel like immutability is the elegant &amp;ldquo;hallelujah&amp;rdquo; solution that&amp;rsquo;s been overlooked. It hasn&amp;rsquo;t been overlooked. It&amp;rsquo;s in the literature, and it&amp;rsquo;s in the practice and industry. It&amp;rsquo;s been refined for decades. It&amp;rsquo;s well worth looking at the problems mature general-purpose databases have solved. New databases are overwhelmingly likely to run into some of them, and perhaps end up implementing the same solutions as well. (Note: I don&amp;rsquo;t claim that there are no mature immutable databases. I&amp;rsquo;m not aware of any, but I bet there are some.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I am not SQL purist or a relational curmudgeon claiming that it&amp;rsquo;s all been done before. I have a lot of respect for the genuinely new advancements in the field, and there is a hell of a lot of it, even in databases whose edge cases I just discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do you think? Also, if I&amp;rsquo;ve gone too far, missed something important, gotten anything wrong, or otherwise need some education myself, please let me know so I can a) learn and b) correct my error.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a public service announcement. Many people I know are not taking important steps necessary to secure their online accounts and devices (computers, cellphones) against malicious people and software. It&amp;rsquo;s a matter of time before something seriously harmful happens to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2013/12/lock.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Lock&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This article will urge you to use &lt;em&gt;higher&lt;/em&gt; security than popular advice you&amp;rsquo;ll hear. &lt;strong&gt;It really, really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; is necessary to use strong measures to secure your digital life.&lt;/strong&gt; The technology being used to attack you is very advanced, operates at a large scale, and you probably stand to lose much more than you realize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it&amp;rsquo;s also &lt;em&gt;much easier than you think to do the basics right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re also likely not as good at being secure as you think you are. If you&amp;rsquo;re like most people, you don&amp;rsquo;t take some important precautions, and you overestimate the strength and effectiveness of security measures you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;password-security&#34;&gt;Password Security&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simplest and most effective way to dramatically boost your online security is &lt;strong&gt;use a password storage program&lt;/strong&gt;, or password safe. You need to &lt;em&gt;stop making passwords you can remember&lt;/em&gt; and make long, random passwords on websites. The only practical way to do this is to use a password safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Update: Security experts from Google disagree with me and suggest that the
most important thing to do is to install security updates. I defer to them; I
think they know more about security than I do. Please &lt;a href=&#34;http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2015/07/new-research-comparing-how-security.html&#34;&gt;read more
here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because if you can remember the password, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/05/how-crackers-make-minced-meat-out-of-your-passwords/&#34;&gt;trivially hackable&lt;/a&gt;. For example, passwords like 10qp29wo38ei47ru can be broken instantly. Anything you can feasibly remember is just too weak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, any rule you set for yourself that requires self-discipline will be violated, because you&amp;rsquo;re lazy. &lt;strong&gt;You need to make security easier so that you automatically do things more securely&lt;/strong&gt;. A password safe is the best way to do that, by far. A good rule of thumb for most people is that you should not try to know your own passwords, except the password to your password safe. (People with the need to be hyper-secure will take extraordinary measures, but those aren&amp;rsquo;t practical or necessary for most of us.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://agilebits.com/onepassword&#34;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;. Others I know of are &lt;a href=&#34;https://lastpass.com/&#34;&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://keepass.info/&#34;&gt;KeePass Password Safe&lt;/a&gt;. I personally wouldn&amp;rsquo;t use any others, because lesser-known ones are more likely to be malware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I like about 1Password is the security audit features, such as
easy analysis of which sites have weak passwords, duplicate passwords, Watchtower to warn you if a site has been compromised and deserves a password change, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to share a password safe&amp;rsquo;s data across devices, and make a backup of it, by using a service such as Dropbox. The password safe&amp;rsquo;s files are encrypted, so the contents will not be at risk even if the file syncing service is compromised for some reason. (Use a strong password to encrypt your password safe!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that online passwords are different from the password you use to log into your personal computer. Online passwords are much more exposed to brute-force, large-scale hacking attacks. By contrast, your laptop probably isn&amp;rsquo;t going to be subjected to a brute-force password cracking attack, because attackers usually need physical access to the computer to do that. This is not a reason to use a weak password for your computer; I&amp;rsquo;m just trying to illustrate how important it is to use &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; long, random passwords for websites and other online services, because they &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; frequent targets of brute-force attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some other important rules for password security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never use the same password in more than one service or login. If you do, someone who compromises it will be able to compromise other services you use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set your password generation program (likely part of your password safe) to make long, random passwords with numbers, special characters, and mixed case. I leave mine set to 20 characters by default. If a website won&amp;rsquo;t accept such a long password I&amp;rsquo;ll shorten it. For popular websites such as LinkedIn, Facebook, etc I use much longer passwords, 50 characters or more. They are such valuable attack targets that I&amp;rsquo;m paranoid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t use your web browser&amp;rsquo;s features for storing passwords and credit cards. Browsers themselves, and their password storage, are the target of many attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never write passwords down on paper, except once. The only paper copy of my passwords is the master password to my computer, password safe, and GPG key. These are in my bank&amp;rsquo;s safe deposit box, because if something happens to me I don&amp;rsquo;t want my family to be completely screwed. (I could write another articleon the need for a will, power of attorney, advance medical directive, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never treat any account online, no matter how trivial, as &amp;ldquo;not important enough for a secure password.&amp;rdquo; This item deserves a little story. Ten years ago I didn&amp;rsquo;t use a password safe, and I treated most websites casually. &amp;ldquo;Oh, this is just a discussion forum, I don&amp;rsquo;t care about it.&amp;rdquo; I used an easy-to-type password for such sites. I used the same one everywhere, and it was a common five-letter English word (not my name, if you&amp;rsquo;re guessing). Suddenly one day I realized that someone could guess this password easily, log in, change the password and in many cases the email address, and lock me out of my own account. They could then proceed to impersonate me, do illegal and harmful things in my name, etc. Worse, they could go find other places that I had accounts (easy to find &amp;ndash; just search Google for my name or username!) and do the same things in many places. I scrambled to find and fix this problem. At the end of it, I realized I had created more than 300 accounts that could have been compromised. Needless to say, I was very, very lucky. My reputation, employment, credit rating, and even my status as a free citizen could have been taken away from me. Don&amp;rsquo;t let this happen to you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;security-questions&#34;&gt;Security Questions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never use real answers to security questions.&lt;/strong&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve guessed my way into many an account, including other people&amp;rsquo;s accounts, by knowing who someone&amp;rsquo;s mother&amp;rsquo;s maiden name was, or paternal grandfather, or whatever. It&amp;rsquo;s usually easy to find this stuff online with a little searching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, always generate unique fake answers. City of birth? The moon. Favorite high school teacher? Swimming pool. First pet? Diesel locomotive. Store these answers in your password safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or generate random answers. As
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/chriswithpants/status/770435827142840320&#34;&gt;Chris Gilbert&lt;/a&gt;
says, here&amp;rsquo;s how to fill out security questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2013/12/security-questions.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Security Questions&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;strong-memorable-passwords-without-a-safe&#34;&gt;Strong, Memorable Passwords Without a Safe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people I know have a set of heuristics to generate a password for each service. &amp;ldquo;Take the first two letters, prepend the year of signup, reverse the last two letters&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; These passwords are a) weak, b) not easy to change since the heuristics don&amp;rsquo;t change, c) easy to figure out if someone gets one of your passwords. In other words, if someone is able to steal your password to, say, Amazon, and figures out from the password &lt;code&gt;no2014amaz&lt;/code&gt; what your heuristic is, they&amp;rsquo;ll be able to log into lots of other services with a little guesswork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel unusually vigorous, you could try out &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scilogs.com/hlf/mental-cryptography-and-good-passwords/&#34;&gt;this person&amp;rsquo;s mental encryption scheme&lt;/a&gt;, but I see a major weakness with that: it doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow for changing your password, since your password is a hashed scheme of the service name. I also think the passwords it generates are less secure than some people have opined them to be, just because they&amp;rsquo;re short. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting but clearly impractical for most people. A password safe is much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another alternative, which I did not know about when I wrote this post, is a
unique physical device to generate passwords. Two that I&amp;rsquo;m aware of are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.qwertycards.com/&#34;&gt;QWERTY
Cards&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.passwordcard.org/&#34;&gt;PasswordCard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2013/12/qwertycards.png&#34; alt=&#34;qwertycard&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These have some shortcomings as well, but there are workarounds:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They can only generate one password per site, so you can&amp;rsquo;t change your password or have multiple logins per site.
Workaround: use different secret words to &amp;ldquo;salt&amp;rdquo; the passwords over time, and
remember which one you&amp;rsquo;re currently using. If you can&amp;rsquo;t log into a site, try
past secret words. Workaround 2: get a new card and keep the old one.
Workaround 3: add a &amp;ldquo;version&amp;rdquo; to the site; for example you might add v1 to
the site name or company name. You could also append a username so you can
have multiple logins, e.g. appending &amp;ldquo;personal&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; or similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They generate strong passwords, which some sites may not accept. For example,
some sites have length limits or forbid &amp;ldquo;special characters&amp;rdquo; in passwords.
Workaround: just use the first N characters of the password. Workaround 2:
translate all &amp;ldquo;special characters&amp;rdquo; to something non-special, such as an
underscore. Neither is foolproof, since you&amp;rsquo;ll have to remember this site as
a special exception, but it may be workable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;avoiding-insecure-sites&#34;&gt;Avoiding Insecure Sites&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limitations on length and special characters that I mentioned in the
previous paragraph are red flags that your password is not secured properly in
their servers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not trust such sites. If you&amp;rsquo;re forced to use them, do so, but otherwise I
would suggest finding another way to do your business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34; lang=&#34;en&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing screams &amp;quot;we are wildly insecure&amp;quot; like a 16-character limit on password length.

&lt;p&gt;Another red flag is when you reset your password and instead of forcing you to create a new one, they a) send your existing one (which means they stored it, which they should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; do) or b) generate a new one and send it to you in email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-two-factor-auth&#34;&gt;Use Two-Factor Auth&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-factor authentication (aka 2-step login) is a much stronger mechanism for account security than a password alone. It uses a &amp;ldquo;second factor&amp;rdquo; (something you physically possess) in addition to the common &amp;ldquo;first factor&amp;rdquo; (something you know &amp;ndash; a password) to verify that you are the person authorized to access the account.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, the login process with two-factor authentication looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You enter your username and password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The service sends a text message to your phone. The message contains a 6-digit number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You must enter the number to finish logging in. With two-factor auth in place, it is very difficult for malicious hackers to access your account, even if they know your password. &lt;strong&gt;Two-factor auth is way more secure than other tactics such as long passwords&lt;/strong&gt;, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t also use a password safe and unique, random, non-memorized passwords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-factor auth has a bunch of special ways to handle other common scenarios, such as devices that can&amp;rsquo;t display the dialog to ask for the 6-digit code, or what if you lose your cellphone, or what if you&amp;rsquo;re away from your own computer and don&amp;rsquo;t have your cellphone. Nonetheless, these edge cases are easy to handle. For example, you can get recovery codes for when you lose or don&amp;rsquo;t have your cellphone. You should store these &amp;ndash; where else? &amp;ndash; in your password safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a perception that lots of people think two-factor auth is not convenient. I disagree. I&amp;rsquo;ve never found it inconvenient, even when I&amp;rsquo;ve lost/destroyed a two-factor device and I use two-factor auth a lot. And I&amp;rsquo;ve never met these people, whoever they are, who think two-factor auth is such a high burden. The worst thing that happens to me is that I sometimes have to get out of my chair and get my phone from another room to log in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most websites don&amp;rsquo;t support two-factor authentication. Fortunately, many of the most popular and valuable services do, including Facebook, Google, Paypal, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Twitter, and most of the other services that you probably use which are most likely to get compromised. &lt;a href=&#34;http://twofactorauth.org/&#34;&gt;Here is a list of services with two-factor auth&lt;/a&gt;, with instructions on how to set it up for each one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please enable two-factor authentication if it is supported!&lt;/strong&gt; I can&amp;rsquo;t tell you how many of my friends and family have had their Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, and other services compromised. Please don&amp;rsquo;t let this happen to you! It could do serious harm to you &amp;ndash; worse than a stolen credit card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please use a code generator such as Google Authenticator instead of SMS&lt;/strong&gt;, if
it is supported. SMS is too easy to hack, and there are many examples of it
happening, usually by social-engineering your phone company&amp;rsquo;s customer support
staff. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wired.com/2016/06/hey-stop-using-texts-two-factor-authentication/&#34;&gt;Read
more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the service supports physical device-based 2-factor&lt;/strong&gt;, use it. Google does,
via products like Yubikey. So does Dropbox, GitHub, Facebook, and a growing
number of others. This is relatively new, so the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.yubico.com/why-yubico/for-individuals/&#34;&gt;Yubikey
website&lt;/a&gt; is probably a good
resource for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, &lt;strong&gt;please save the recovery codes in your password safe&lt;/strong&gt; so if you
lose/destroy your two-factor device you can regain access to the account.
An easy way to do this is to take a screenshot of the QR code when you associate
your account with Google Authenticator and save the screenshot in your password
vault.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion I&amp;rsquo;ve heard, for websites and services that don&amp;rsquo;t offer strong security and for which you don&amp;rsquo;t want or need to remember or store a password, is to just reset your password every single time you log in. In this way, your email account effectively becomes external authentication, and every password becomes single-use. You click &amp;ldquo;forgot password,&amp;rdquo; check your email, click on the link there, enter some random gibberish (best generated with &lt;code&gt;pwgen 50&lt;/code&gt; or similar) for your &amp;ldquo;new password&amp;rdquo; that you&amp;rsquo;re never going to use again, and log in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;secure-your-devices&#34;&gt;Secure Your Devices&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sooner or later someone is going to get access to one of your devices &amp;ndash; tablet, phone, laptop, thumb drive. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had a phone or laptop lost or stolen myself, but it&amp;rsquo;s a matter of time. I&amp;rsquo;ve known a lot of people in this situation. One of my old bosses, for example, forgot a laptop in the seat pocket of an airplane, and someone took it and didn&amp;rsquo;t return it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And how many times have you heard about some government worker leaving a laptop at the coffee shop and suddenly millions of people&amp;rsquo;s Social Security numbers are stolen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about your phone. If someone stole my phone and it weren&amp;rsquo;t protected, they&amp;rsquo;d have access to a bunch of my accounts, contact lists, email, and a lot of other stuff I really, really do not want them messing with. If you&amp;rsquo;re in the majority of people who leave your phone completely unsecured, think about the consequences for a few minutes. Someone getting access to all the data and accounts on your phone could probably ruin your life for a long time if they wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this is easily preventable. Given that one or more of your devices will someday certainly end up in the hands of someone who may have bad intentions, I think it&amp;rsquo;s only prudent to take some basic measures:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the device to require a password, lock code, or pattern to be used to unlock it after it goes to sleep, when it&amp;rsquo;s idle for a bit, or when you first power it on. If someone steals your device, and can access it without entering your password, you&amp;rsquo;re well and truly screwed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use full-device encryption. If someone steals your device, for heaven&amp;rsquo;s sake don&amp;rsquo;t let them have access to your data. For Mac users, use File Vault under Preferences / Security and Privacy. Encrypt the whole drive, not just the home directory. On Windows, use &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.truecrypt.org/&#34;&gt;TrueCrypt&lt;/a&gt;, and on Linux, you probably already know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On Android tablets and phones, you can encrypt the entire device. You have to set up a screen lock code first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use a thumb drive or external hard drive to transfer files between devices, encrypt it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypt your backup hard drives. Backups are one of the most common ways that data is stolen. &lt;em&gt;(You have backups, right? I could write a book on backups. Three things are inevitable: death, taxes, and loss of data that you really care about.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a service such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://preyproject.com/&#34;&gt;Prey Project&lt;/a&gt; to let you have at least some basic control over your device if it&amp;rsquo;s lost or stolen.  Android phones now have the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/android/devicemanager&#34;&gt;Android Device Manager&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://maps.google.com/locationhistory/&#34;&gt;Google Location History&lt;/a&gt;, but you have to enable these.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep records of your devices&amp;rsquo; make, model, serial number, and so on. Prey Project makes this easy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On your phone or tablet, customize the lockscreen with a message such as &amp;ldquo;user@email.com &amp;#8211; reward if found&amp;rdquo; and on your laptops, stick a small label inside the lid with your name and phone number. You never know if a nice person will return something to you. I know I would do it for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;things-that-don-t-help&#34;&gt;Things that don&amp;rsquo;t help&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, here are some techniques that aren&amp;rsquo;t as useful as you might have been told.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing passwords doesn&amp;rsquo;t significantly enhance security unless you change from an insecure password to a strong one. Changing passwords is most useful, in my opinion, when a service has already been compromised or potentially compromised. It&amp;rsquo;s possible on any given day that an attacker has gotten a list of encrypted passwords for a service, hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet been discovered, and hasn&amp;rsquo;t yet decrypted them, and that you&amp;rsquo;ll foil the attack by changing your password in the meanwhile, but this is such a vanishingly small chance that it&amp;rsquo;s not meaningful. Actually, some leading technologists sensibly say that &lt;a href=&#34;http://arstechnica.com/security/2016/08/frequent-password-changes-are-the-enemy-of-security-ftc-technologist-says/&#34;&gt;frequent password changes make you less secure, not more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(OK, this ended up being a list of 1 thing. Tell me what else should go here.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;summary&#34;&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a summary of the most valuable steps you can take to protect yourself:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get a password safe, and use it for all of your accounts. Protect it with a long password. Make this the &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; password you memorize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use long (as long as possible), randomly generated passwords for all online accounts and services, and &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; reuse a password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use two-factor authentication for all services that support it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encrypt your hard drives, phones and tablets, and backups, and use a password or code to lock all computers, phones, tablets, etc when you turn them off, leave them idle, or put them to sleep.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install something like Prey Project on your portable devices, and label them so nice people can return them to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write down the location and access instructions (including passwords) for your password safe, computer, backup hard drives, etc and put it in a safe deposit box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friends try not to let friends get hacked and ruined. Don&amp;rsquo;t stop at upgrading your own security. Please tell your friends and family to do it, too!&lt;/li&gt;

          <title>Under-Provisioning: The Curse Of The Cloud</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;A common problem I see people running into when using a cloud computing service is the trap of under-provisioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2010/06/chinchilla.png&#34; alt=&#34;Chinchilla&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a chain effect that leads to under-provisioning: 1) people don&amp;rsquo;t understand how virtualization works, and therefore 2) they don&amp;rsquo;t realize how much of a computing resource they&amp;rsquo;re really buying, so 3) they assume they are entitled to more than they really are, and 4) they under-provision. A few other causes and effects come into play here, too. For example, the choice to use the cloud is sometimes founded on economic assumptions that frequently turn out to be wrong. The cloud service looks more economically attractive than it really is, due to under-provisioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s get back to this idea that people under-provision. How do I know that&amp;rsquo;s happening? I&amp;rsquo;ll use anecdotal evidence to illustrate. Here&amp;rsquo;s a real quote from a recent engagement about database (MySQL) performance problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think it&amp;rsquo;s likely that the underlying hardware is simply worse than average? If you think this will be an ongoing problem, maybe we should try our luck with a new instance/storage cluster?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fundamental assumption here is that some clusters are overloaded and are giving poor quality of service. We&amp;rsquo;re trained to think this way because we are familiar with services such as shared hosting, where other users on your particular server might really be abusive and claim resources that should be yours. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t how virtualization works in the common cloud platforms. In these platforms, you aren&amp;rsquo;t sharing resources with other users. You are guaranteed to get what you deserve! No kidding &amp;ndash; this actually works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If that&amp;rsquo;s true, then why does performance fluctuate so much? The answer lies in how resources are parceled out. Assume there are 10 units of computing resources, and you&amp;rsquo;re paying for one of them. You buy 1/10th of the machine&amp;rsquo;s power. But it just happens that you&amp;rsquo;re the only virtual instance running on that physical server. You fire up an intense job. How much power do you get? You paid for 1 unit, &lt;strong&gt;but you get 10, because no one else is using the other 9 units.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the way most virtualization platforms work: they give you extra resources if they&amp;rsquo;re available and not being claimed by anyone else&amp;rsquo;s instance. This guarantees that you&amp;rsquo;ll never get less than you deserve, but it leaves open the possibility that you&amp;rsquo;ll get more than you deserve. (What would be the point of wasting that power, really?) Under-provisioning is the obverse of over-providing, which is what the virtualization platform does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First-generation hyperthreading gave the same illusion of more resources than are really available, by the way. It made you think there were multiple processors, when in fact there weren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ndash; there were multiple sets of registers. Hyperthreading is a form of virtualization, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What typically happens is that people are running their cloud instances on machines whose underlying physical hardware is not fully utilized, and they get used to a certain level of performance they&amp;rsquo;re not really paying for. Alas, you can&amp;rsquo;t really know whether this is happening or not! But it surely is in many (most?) cases, which is why occasionally you get some resource that seems much slower than you&amp;rsquo;re accustomed to, and you think it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;too slow.&amp;rdquo; Not so. Your other units are &amp;ldquo;too fast.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a theory that if you really knew the true capacity you were buying, you&amp;rsquo;d view the price-to-performance ratio much less favorably. But it&amp;rsquo;s almost impossible to know that, really; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that the cloud service providers are rather vague about how much power a certain instance size really gives you. (They aren&amp;rsquo;t being malicious; it&amp;rsquo;s just the way virtualization works.) Under-provisioning is almost forced on users because they have no alternative &amp;ndash; you could plan for worst-case performance, and you&amp;rsquo;d be doing the right thing, but how will you ever know you&amp;rsquo;ve really hit rock bottom and the worst case is really no worse? How can you even benchmark and do proper capacity planning, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you&amp;rsquo;re benchmarking? This should really give you serious pause. You should be thinking &amp;ldquo;wait, I&amp;rsquo;m basing my capacity planning and provisioning on luck and the law of large numbers. What if my luck runs out and I get a Black Swan event?&amp;rdquo; The question is not &amp;ldquo;what if,&amp;rdquo; but &amp;ldquo;when.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also think that the lack of transparency encourages people to use cloud computing services for the wrong reasons altogether. I could write about this, but I think &lt;a href=&#34;http://lethargy.org/~jesus/writes/thoughts-on-the-cloud&#34;&gt;Theo Schlossnagle said it pretty well already&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
