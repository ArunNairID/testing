        <span class="post-date">Tue, Nov 10, 2015</span>
        <p>At Velocity/OSCON 2015 in Amsterdam a couple of weeks ago, the conference
committee approached me to ask if I&rsquo;d be up for doing an Ignite talk. It was
rather last-minute and I had only hours to prepare. I said yes and then tried to
think of a topic. I turned to Twitter and asked, if you could have me talk for 5
minutes on any topic, what would it be? A couple of people responded that they
wanted to know what founding a company was like, so I sat down in the speaker
lounge at the RAI and started trying to figure out what it&rsquo;s like to be a
founder/CEO.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d know after three years, but truthfully, it&rsquo;s still hard to
really know what I feel.</p>

        <p><strong>Why DevOps needs a manifesto after all, but may never get one.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/media/2015/02/rplusl_brain.jpg" alt="brain" /></p>

<p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2015/01/the-devops-identity-crisis.html">O&rsquo;Reilly Radar</a>.</em></p>

<p>DevOps is everywhere! The growth and mindshare of the movement is remarkable. But if you care deeply about DevOps, you might agree with me when I say that although its moment has “arrived,” DevOps is in serious trouble. The movement is fragmented and weakly defined, and is being usurped by those who care more about short-term opportunities than the long-term viability of DevOps.</p>

        <p>This should sound familiar:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the great lies about NoSQL databases is that they&rsquo;re simple. Simplicity
done wrong makes things a lot harder and more complicated to develop and
operate. Programmers and operations staff end up reimplementing (badly) things
the database should do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody argued this line of reasoning more vigorously than when trying to defend
relational databases, especially during the darkest years (ca.  2009-2010), when
NoSQL still meant <strong>NO SQL DAMMIT</strong>, all sorts of NoSQL databases were
sprouting, and most of them were massively overhyped.  But as valid as those
arguments against NoSQL&rsquo;s &ldquo;false economy&rdquo; simplicity were and are, the arguments
against relational databases&rsquo; complexity hold true, too.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 29, 2014</span>
        <p>I have $10 that says you&rsquo;ve experienced this before: there&rsquo;s a holiday, trade show, or other important event coming up. Management is worried about the risk of an outage during this all-important time, and restricts deployments from the week prior through the end of the event.</p>

<p>What really happens, of course, is that the system in question becomes booby-trapped with extra risk. As a result, problems are more likely, and when there there is even a slight issue, it has the potential to escalate into a major crisis.</p>

<p>Why does this happen? As usual, there&rsquo;s no single root cause, but a variety of problems combine to create a brittle, risky situation.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/11/freeze.png" alt="freeze" /></p>

<h3 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h3>

<p>When managers declare a freeze, they&rsquo;re not being malicious. They&rsquo;re doing something that seems to make sense. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to understand the reasoning.</p>

        <p>Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to find the root cause of that downtime incident? Many people
would. But experience has taught me that there is no such thing as a single root
cause. Instead, there&rsquo;s a chain of interrelated causes, each of which is
necessary but none of which is sufficient to cause the overall problem.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jul 5, 2014</span>
        <p>Focus is perhaps the most important attribute in an organization. In fact, my dictionary defines an organization as &ldquo;an organized body of people with a particular purpose&hellip;&rdquo; A focused organization recognizes and cleaves to its purpose.</p>

<p>Likewise, the ability to create and sustain focus is perhaps the most valuable skill of the organization&rsquo;s members, including both individual contributors and leaders.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-focus-and-why-is-it-hard">What Is Focus, And Why Is It Hard?</h3>

<p>My dictionary says focus is &ldquo;an act of concentrating.&rdquo; Consider the root words: <em>concentrate</em> literally means to bring to a common center, to be centered together.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Jun 8, 2014</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve had conversations about time-series databases with many people over the last couple of years. I <a href="/blog/2014/03/02/time-series-databases-influxdb/">wrote previously</a> about some of the open-source technologies that people commonly use for time-series storage.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/06/timeseries.jpg" alt="Time Series" /></p>

<p>Because I have my own ideas about what constitutes a good time-series database, and because a few people have asked me to describe my requirements, I have decided to publish my thoughts here. All opinions that follow are my own, and as you read you should mentally add &ldquo;in my opinion&rdquo; to every sentence.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, May 24, 2014</span>
        <p>Once upon a time I managed several teams of consultants. At a certain stage of the organization&rsquo;s growth, we wanted to achieve a higher billable-time utilization more easily, and we wanted more structure and process.</p>

<p>Cary Millsap, about whom I have written quite a bit elsewhere on this blog, suggested that I might profit from reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951/?tag=xaprb-20"><em>The Goal</em></a> by Eliyahu Goldratt. I will let history be the judge of the outcome, but from my perspective, this was revolutionary for me. It is a clear watershed moment in my memory: I lived life one way and saw things through one lens before, and afterwards everything was different.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 18, 2014</span>
        <p>Do you know how to tune a guitar? I mean, do you <em>really</em> know how to tune a
guitar?</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/01/guitar-tuning.jpg" alt="Guitar Closeup" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve met very few people who do. Most people pick some notes, crank the tuners,
play some chords, and endlessly fidget back and forth until they either get
something that doesn&rsquo;t sound awful to their ears, or they give up. I can&rsquo;t
recall ever seeing a professional musician look like a tuning pro on stage,
either. This really ought to be embarrassing to someone who makes music for a
career.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a secret to tuning an instrument. Very few people seem to know it. It&rsquo;s
surprisingly simple, it isn&rsquo;t at all what you might expect, and it makes it easy
and quick to tune an instrument <em>accurately</em> without guesswork. However, even
though it&rsquo;s simple and logical, it is difficult and subtle at first, and
requires training your ear. This is a neurological, physical, and mental process
that takes some time and practice. It does <em>not</em> require &ldquo;perfect pitch,&rdquo;
however.</p>

<p>In this blog post I&rsquo;ll explain how it works. There&rsquo;s a surprising amount of
depth to it, which appeals to the nerd in me. If you&rsquo;re looking for &ldquo;the short
version,&rdquo; you won&rsquo;t find it here, because I find the math, physics, and theory
of tuning to be fascinating, and I want to share that and not just the quick
how-to.</p>

        <p>Not long ago I attended a talk about Datomic, which focused a lot on database
immutability and its benefits. I hope to illustrate why many database designs
are much more complicated than Datomic and its ilk. Although Datomic&rsquo;s design
can be presented as <em>advanced</em>, there&rsquo;s another side to the story, which also
holds true for similar databases such as CouchDB. It&rsquo;s a really difficult
problem space, and clean and elegant solutions without nasty edge cases are
difficult to design and implement.</p>

<p>This article will urge you to use <em>higher</em> security than popular advice you&rsquo;ll hear. <strong>It really, really, <em>really</em> is necessary to use strong measures to secure your digital life.</strong> The technology being used to attack you is very advanced, operates at a large scale, and you probably stand to lose much more than you realize.</p>

<p>However, it&rsquo;s also <em>much easier than you think to do the basics right.</em></p>
