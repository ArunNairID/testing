        <span class="post-date">Sun, Feb 21, 2016</span>
        <p>I noticed recently that Google Play Music has a set of features I wasn&rsquo;t aware
of before, and decided to give it a try. Through various kinds of <a href="http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html">yak
shaving</a>,
I ended up tackling a project I&rsquo;d wanted to look into for a while: <strong>which
formats and settings are really the best for lossy music compression?</strong></p>

<p>What I learned was both fun and surprising, and ultimately highly practical. If
you&rsquo;re in a hurry, the summary is that high-quality variable-bitrate MP3
produced with the LAME encoder is probably the best all-around choice if you
want broad compatibility; if you want the best sound quality, though, AAC (Apple&rsquo;s native format) or Ogg Vorbis are much better than MP3.</p>

<p>But before I get to that, let&rsquo;s sharpen some yak razors, shall we?</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Apr 4, 2015</span>
        <p>Everyone loves (or
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/switched-standing-desk-now">mocks</a>)
a good standing desk, but most of us don&rsquo;t love the price.
Adjustable sit/stand desks and bolt-on apparatus I&rsquo;ve seen cost up to $1000 to
$5000. I have a feeling if you get something on the cheap end of that scale, you
probably will regret it. There are less expensive ones that just sit on your
desk, but they seem like abominations I would hate to use.</p>

<p>As an alternative I won&rsquo;t regret because it&rsquo;s cheap and minimalistic, I&rsquo;ve
been using a simple but effective
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QXIFCC/?tag=xaprb-20">adjustable laptop holder</a>
for a few years. It&rsquo;s easy to place on a desktop or counter. At this point there
are a few of them at work and one at home. I keep recommending them to friends
so I might as well just post it here too.</p>

        <p>In <a href="/blog/2013/07/10/ultimate-notebook-and-journal-face-off/">The Ultimate Notebook</a>,
I reviewed a large list of notebooks I bought in my quest for the perfect one
for me. (I&rsquo;m happy to say that I&rsquo;ve been using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072WW8K4/?tag=xaprb-20">Quo Vadis Habana in Raspberry</a> exclusively
for a while). But what about the perfect pen? Ah, pens. As much a personal
matter as notebooks are. I&rsquo;ve tried a variety of pens. Here&rsquo;s my review of some
of them.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, May 24, 2014</span>
        <p>Once upon a time I managed several teams of consultants. At a certain stage of the organization&rsquo;s growth, we wanted to achieve a higher billable-time utilization more easily, and we wanted more structure and process.</p>

<p>Cary Millsap, about whom I have written quite a bit elsewhere on this blog, suggested that I might profit from reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Goal-Process-Ongoing-Improvement/dp/0884271951/?tag=xaprb-20"><em>The Goal</em></a> by Eliyahu Goldratt. I will let history be the judge of the outcome, but from my perspective, this was revolutionary for me. It is a clear watershed moment in my memory: I lived life one way and saw things through one lens before, and afterwards everything was different.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve used active noise-cancelling headphones for over ten years now, and have owned several pairs of Bose, one of Sony, and most recently a pair of Sennheiser headphones.</p>

        <p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you spend so much time typing on a computer that a good notebook or journal is one of life&rsquo;s finer pleasures. I&rsquo;ve kept a diary of my personal life for close to 30 years now, and I have a shelf full of journals. I&rsquo;ve found a great many that I enjoy writing in, and choosing a different one each time is part of the fun.</p>

<p>But thus far, my quest for a notepad has been unsatisfying. Many notepads have loved me, but I&rsquo;m sorry to say their love has been unrequited. I&rsquo;ve tried all the usual things: Moleskine, loose-leaf paper, binders, what have you. But I never found something that is practical, functional, a joy to write on, and a pleasure to look at and hold. I just can&rsquo;t settle into a long-term relationship with my notebook, because I haven&rsquo;t met The Right One yet.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Mar 22, 2013</span>
        I&rsquo;ve been trying out Republic Wireless, a startup that offers very inexpensive wireless service: $19 for unlimited talk, text, and data. In a nutshell: they resell Sprint&rsquo;s network, and you agree to connect to wifi as much as possible; they use the Internet instead of the cell network when you&rsquo;re on wifi. I thought for $19/month it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to give it a try. After several months, my experience has been that it isn&rsquo;t worth using at all, no matter how cheap it is.

This is a lucid and interesting introduction to Clojure and the LISP family of programming languages. It&rsquo;s been years since I programmed in LISP and I found myself recalling those days, at the same time as I learned a lot more than I used to know. Indeed, I realized that my knowledge of LISP was only superficial, and that I probably ought to take some time at some point and learn it deeply enough to have the epiphany people talk about.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jun 28, 2011</span>
        tl;dr version: I like XFCE better than Gnome 3.
I wrote previously about trying out Gnome 3. I&rsquo;ve been using it for about a month now, and it&rsquo;s time for me to make a decision about whether to keep using it or revert to Gnome 2. I&rsquo;m actually on vacation, which ends soon. I need to do this before vacation ends, so I can be fully productive at work.
My ultimate impression of Gnome 3 is that it&rsquo;s very slick, and makes significant improvements in some ways, but it&rsquo;s not very usable for my purposes, and has too many self-contradictions.

The quality of the writing is way above the average technical book. Techniques that feel gimmicky and forced in other books, such as fake stories to introduce each chapter, actually work here (because they&rsquo;re real stories, not fake ones).

This is a pocket-sized guide to setting up and managing MySQL replication. It is self-published and made via print-on-demand technology. Topics include how replication works, setting up replication, making backups, and administering replication after it&rsquo;s working. There are several appendixes for replication-related functionality in the MySQL server and command-line tools.
This book doesn&rsquo;t go into great depth, so don&rsquo;t expect it to be a reference manual to replication internals or anything like that.

This is a good book for PostgreSQL database administrators to pick up, especially if you&rsquo;re new to PostgreSQL but familiar with another system such as Oracle, SQL Server, or MySQL. It has more than 80 &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; that range from quick tips to moderately detailed discussion of how to accomplish specific tasks. The chapters and recipes are well organized, and you can either read the book from start to finish or jump to a specific recipe for quick help.

Fedora 15 and Gnome 3 have awesome support for my laptop&rsquo;s hardware. It&rsquo;s simply flawless. You could not expect better software/hardware integration if you paid thousands of dollars for something from Steve Jobs.

I never thought I&rsquo;d get a tablet, until my phone died and I got a Droid 2 as a replacement.

        Relational Database Index Design and the Optimizers. By Tapio Lahdenmaki and Mike Leach, Wiley 2005.
I picked this book up on the advice of an Oracle expert, and after one of my colleagues had read it and mentioned it to me. The focus is on how to design indexes that will produce the best performance for various types of queries. It goes into quite a bit of detail on how databases execute specific types of queries, including sort-merge joins and multiple index access, and develops a generic cost model that can be used to produce a quick upper-bound estimate (QUBE) for the execution time of a query.

        Guerrilla Capacity Planning  Guerrilla Capacity Planning. By Neil J. Gunther, Springer 2007. Page count: about 200 pages, plus appendixes. (Here&rsquo;s a link to the publisher&rsquo;s site.)
Of all the books I&rsquo;ve reviewed, this one has taken me the longest to study first. That&rsquo;s because there is a lot of math involved, and Neil Gunther knows a lot more about it than I do. Here&rsquo;s the short version: I&rsquo;m learning how to use this in the real world, but that&rsquo;s going to take many months, probably years.

        Cloud Application Architectures  Cloud Application Architectures. By George Reese, O&rsquo;Reilly 2009. (Here&rsquo;s a link to the publisher&rsquo;s site).
This is a great book on how to build apps in the cloud! I was happy to see how much depth it went into. It&rsquo;s short &ndash; 150 pages plus some appendixes &ndash; so I was expecting it to be a superficial overview. But it isn&rsquo;t. It is thorough. And it is also obviously built on his own experience building very specific applications that he uses to run his business &ndash; he isn&rsquo;t preaching about stuff he doesn&rsquo;t know first-hand.
