I wrote a chapter for this book, and it&rsquo;s now on shelves in bookstores near you. I got my dead-tree copy today and read everyone else&rsquo;s contributions to it. It&rsquo;s a good book. A group effort such as this one is necessarily going to have some differences in style and even overlapping content, but overall it works very well.

This book is due out in about a month. It is part of O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s Beautiful series, which you might know through Beautiful Code. This one&rsquo;s about web ops, of course. There are a dozen contributors, including some of my favorites such as Theo Schlossnagle, whose Scalable Internet Architectures is on my (quite short) list of essential books.

Short version: buy it and read it, but make sure you don&rsquo;t rely on it alone; deepen your knowledge through other sources.
I bought and read this book because I&rsquo;m interested in performance, performance forecasting, and capacity planning. I&rsquo;m not interested in forecasting Oracle performance per se.

        ASUS-UL30A-X5
I&rsquo;ve had an ASUS-UL30A-X5 for about two weeks now. This is the nicest laptop I&rsquo;ve ever owned (and I was a laptop owner before that was cool). I&rsquo;m absolutely thrilled.
I used a Dell Inspiron 1501 for the last 4 years, the AMD model. Everything was a pain due to poor Linux compatibility. I blamed some of it on other things. For example, I thought my external monitor was low quality because all the pixels crawled like ants.

I should have read this book a long time ago, and it&rsquo;s my loss that I didn&rsquo;t. Although the title makes it sound like it should only benefit those who&rsquo;ll be changing the MySQL server&rsquo;s own code, that&rsquo;s not true. To the contrary, at least parts of this book should be required reading for DBAs and developers who use MySQL, after they gain a moderate level of familiarity with how to use the server.

The right word to describe this book falls somewhere between &ldquo;tome&rdquo; and &ldquo;lunker.&rdquo; You could beat back an unwelcome salesperson with it. You could also beat back any number of stubborn database problems.

        VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers MySQL performance monitoring and PostgreSQL performance management among many other features.

This is a quite short book that covers some of the breadth but very little of the depth of Cacti.

My wife bought a copy of this book, and recently I took it off her bookshelf to give it a read myself.
I found the book very lucid and readable. The author does not drag us through a bunch of formalisms, nor does she attempt to force the book to be readable through the use of comics, pop-culture references, or other artificial devices.

So far I&rsquo;m delighted. I&rsquo;m 6-foot-4 (195cm) and this is one of the only chairs I&rsquo;ve ever seen that seats my height comfortably, both in terms of seat height and in terms of being tall enough to relax back into (the headrest extends up high enough to support my head and neck nicely).

I've been wanting to write a review of this book for a while. I forget now exactly when I got it, but I have greatly enjoyed reading it. I have read it several times. It's a book on decision making (it's not really a book about chess) from a man who's Russian (which matters because I work with many Russians), a master of decision making, and not least of all -- he has taken on the world's toughest opponents and continues to do so today.

        I&rsquo;ve just finished reading Scalable Internet Architectures by Theo Schlossnagle. It&rsquo;s a great book. Anyone building large systems should read it. Heck, anyone building any system that needs to run on more than one server should read it.
The book got mixed reviews on Amazon, but I really think that&rsquo;s about writing style, not substance. Sometimes Theo takes the reader on a scenic tour of something that doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much to do with the subject matter, and then wraps up by showing how it is actually directly relevant.

Unfortunately, this book didn&rsquo;t help me much. I&rsquo;d give it 2 out of 5 stars.

        In my opinion, every Perl programmer needs at least these two books: the Camel, and the Dog (Perl Best Practices).
The Camel teaches you how to program Perl: the syntax and so on. But the Dog teaches you how to program Perl sanely, by recommending that you use only a subset of Perl&rsquo;s syntax and abilities.
The Camel tells you that there&rsquo;s more than one way to do it, which is supposed to be a strength of Perl.
