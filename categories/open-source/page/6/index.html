        I haven&rsquo;t really decided my schedule yet during the conference, but I thought I&rsquo;d mention these sessions that look interesting to me.
I&rsquo;m presenting a session on how to use Maatkit, which I think attendees will get a lot of benefit from.
 Tuesday  This is Not a Web App: The Evolution of a MySQL Deployment at Google (keynote). Mark Callaghan, need I say more? MySQL and Search at Craigslist.

        Some unsettling things happened in MySQL in the past week or so.
New storage engine not mentioned in the changelog There&rsquo;s a bit of a storm brewing over at the MySQL Performance Blog, where Vadim reports discovering a new storage engine added without mention in the 5.1.33 changelog. This is in defiance of the policy of not making changes in a production release. And it certainly belongs in the changelog &ndash; but there is no sign that anyone will remedy this problem.

        Maatkit version 3329 has been released, as per our usual monthly release cycle.
Significant changes in this version include some bug fixes to mk-duplicate-key-checker, and a lot of new features in mk-query-digest. We made some changes to mk-table-checksum and mk-table-sync. We also updated shared code in all tools.
Interesting and significant things to mention this month:
 Thanks to a corporation who sponsored development on certain tools (I haven&rsquo;t gotten permission to mention their name.

        Here&rsquo;s a quick productivity tip: when optimizing queries by rewriting them to different forms that should return the same results, you can verify that you get the same results by taking a checksum of them.
Just set your pager to md5sum:
mysql&gt; pager md5sum - PAGER set to 'md5sum -' mysql&gt; select * from test; a09bc56ac9aa0cbcc659c3d566c2c7e4 - 4096 rows in set (0.00 sec)

        If you&rsquo;ve been holding out for that golden opportunity, now&rsquo;s a great time to get involved in Maatkit.
Until now I haven&rsquo;t really made a conscious effort to open-source the decision process and get people involved; Maatkit has been largely driven by so-called &ldquo;real-world needs,&rdquo; as perceived through my little lens on the world (and emails from the whole Percona team telling me when something&rsquo;s wrong). I guess I am likely to remain some kind of benevolent dictator, because I created Maatkit and historically I&rsquo;m the main hacker.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Mar 7, 2009</span>
        After I wrote about things you need to know about MySQL backups, a customer contacted me and asked me what I know about SecoBackup for MySQL. I see it has a very low cost and Percona has Amazon accounts for testing purposes, so I quickly downloaded s3sql_2.2.0.1-2.01_i386.deb, installed it, configured it, and gave it a whirl.
Since I just want to see what it does to take a backup, I started up a sandbox running from /tmp/12345 and configured it to backup msandbox:msandbox@127.

        After a long time working mostly on Maatkit and neglecting innotop, Aaron Racine has stepped forward to take over the development. I moved it off Sourceforge (for the same reasons I moved Maatkit) and onto Google Code. Aaron has set up mailing lists and so on, and there is a discussion about which features to add and change. Your input is welcomed on the mailing lists!

        Thunderbird&rsquo;s email search isn&rsquo;t that great by today&rsquo;s standards. If I type &ldquo;red dog&rdquo; into the search bar it doesn&rsquo;t even tokenize and search for the words separately &ndash; it&rsquo;s a substring match so &ldquo;my dog is red&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t found. And it&rsquo;s slow.
What about embedding &ldquo;real&rdquo; fulltext search into it? Sphinx perhaps?
Just a thought.

        I was just talking to someone who backs up their MySQL servers once a day with mysqldump, and I said in a catastrophe, you&rsquo;re going to have to reload from a backup; that&rsquo;s some amount of downtime, plus up to a day of lost data.
And they said &ldquo;We can just promote a replica, we&rsquo;ve done it before. It works fine.&rdquo;
Granted, in some/many cases, this is fine. There are all sorts of caveats &ndash; for example, you either know that your slave has the same data as the master or you don&rsquo;t care.

        I note that Maatkit has been deemed unworthy to mention on Wikipedia. Someone emailed me the deletion log today:
 20:13, 10 July 2008 Djsasso (Talk | contribs) deleted &ldquo;Maatkit&rdquo; â€Ž (WP:PROD, reason was &lsquo;Non-notable application, single primary source&rsquo;.)
 I have never been a very big promoter. I prefer to let people promote things themselves, and I try for a policy of attraction rather than promotion myself.
With that said, I often hear people saying some variant of &ldquo;Maatkit saved my behind, thanks so much.

        Mark Wong&rsquo;s entry titled &ldquo;Following up a couple questions from the presentation at PSU on January 8, 2009&rdquo; just caught my eye:
 What is &lsquo;iopp&rsquo;?
It&rsquo;s a custom tool to go through the Linux process table to get i/o statistics per process. It is open source and can be downloaded from:
http://git.postgresql.org/?p=~markwkm/iopp.git;a=summary
 If you know me, you know I can&rsquo;t pass up &ldquo;I/O statistics per process.&rdquo; No way. So, after a moment of browsing the code, which is short and to the point, I tried it out:

        This is actually old news, but I never thought to file a bug report (until now) or say anything to anyone about it. If you use mysqldump to dump and restore a MySQL table that has INSERT triggers, you can get different data in your restored database than you had when you dumped. The problem? The tool dumps the triggers before the data, so they get added back to the table before the rows are inserted.

        This release of Maatkit is basically all about mk-log-parser, our new log analysis tool. Daniel and I have been working hard on it all month, adding killer new features like &#8211;review, fixing tons of bugs, and making it twice as fast. I believe it&rsquo;s far and away the best slow-log analysis tool in existence, both in terms of functionality and quality. (Do any of the other tools even have test suites&hellip;?

        The December release is here! There are some goodies in this release, but the major one is an initial version of mk-log-parser, a slow log analysis tool that is carefully designed (with lots of input from Percona consultants) to make slow log analysis as productive and easy as possible. It&rsquo;s based on a lot of work Daniel and I have done on log analysis over the years (I actually wrote the initial version a long time ago but never released it).

        Google Code just rocks. It is clean, sparse, elegant, and it has all the functionality I need. Its template-driven issue tracking system (totally flexible and totally easy to flex!), niceties like cross-references between issues and Subversion revisions, simple but completely adequate Wiki, and nice download system are the bomb. And the code reviews and ability to comment on revisions are super nice. Oh, and it&rsquo;s really nice that the data is stored in a place I feel pretty sure is safe.

        MySQL just released their new MySQL Query Analyzer (link to a trial), and recently wrote up an interview with Mark Matthews about it. If you haven&rsquo;t read that article, go ahead and do it. I have not used this software, but I fully believe its functionality is quite nice.
But there is at least one alternative, which has been available for a long time. That is the Percona patch-set, plus analysis tools such as mysqlsla or Maatkit&rsquo;s query analysis tools.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 1, 2008</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;m really really happy about <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu 8.10</a> because it lets me stop kicking myself so much for buying a Dell Inspiron 1501. This little laptop was the el-cheapo option for me, found via <a href="http://www.dealnews.com/">dealnews.com</a>. I was going to buy the virtually identical one that came with Ubuntu installed, but then Dell offered a deal on the 1501, which had Windows Vista, and I caved in to the allure of saving about $200.</p>

<p>Of course I promptly discovered that the two most important differences between the models involved hardware for which no good Free Software drivers existed: the video card and the wireless card. The Inspiron 1501 has a &ldquo;ATI Technologies Inc RS482 [Radeon Xpress 200M]&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Broadcom Corporation BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN (rev 01)&rdquo;.</p>
