        <span class="post-date">Tue, Mar 9, 2010</span>
        I&rsquo;ve submitted a Birds of a Feather session for Maatkit at the upcoming MySQL conference. It&rsquo;s not on the public schedule yet, but it has been accepted and scheduled for 19:00 on 13 Apr 2010. See you there!

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Feb 22, 2010</span>
        Cary Millsap has a concise, readable paper on performance. Anyone involved in database performance optimization should read it. Cary&rsquo;s writing has heavily influenced the mk-query-digest tool for analyzing MySQL/PostgreSQL/Memcached/HTTP query performance, and I think you&rsquo;ll get a lot more from mk-query-digest if you read this paper &ndash; and you should also read his book, reviewed here. It&rsquo;s one of the top books on my Essential Books List.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Feb 20, 2010</span>
        I&rsquo;ll be attending PgEast this year, as I&rsquo;ve done for the last couple of years, and this year I&rsquo;ll also be speaking. The topic is query analysis with mk-query-digest. The official description of my talk is as follows:
 mk-query-digest is a powerful open-source tool for capturing, filtering, transforming, and aggregating queries, with the ability to do all sorts of other advanced tasks too. By default, it aggregates similar queries together and presents a designed-for-DBAs report with statistics about the most important queries, so you can see where to focus your optimization efforts.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Feb 20, 2010</span>
        Maatkit does more than just MySQL. I&rsquo;ve just committed a new version of mk-query-digest, a powerful log analysis tool, with support for Posgtres logs, in both syslog and stderr format. I&rsquo;m hoping that people will give this a spin in the real world. I have lots of test cases, but that&rsquo;s never enough; I&rsquo;m looking for people to crunch their logs and let me know if anything breaks.
A brief tutorial:

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 9, 2010</span>
        <p>The <code>iostat</code> tool is one of the most important for measuring disk performance, which of course is very relevant for database administrators, whether your chosen database is Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, or anything else that runs on GNU/Linux. Have you ever wondered where statistics like await (average wait for the request to complete) come from? If you look at the disk statistics the <a href="http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/iostats.txt">Linux kernel makes available through files such as /proc/diskstats</a>, you won&rsquo;t see await there. How does iostat compute await? For that matter, how does it compute the average queue size, service time, and utilization? This blog post will show you how that&rsquo;s computed.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 5, 2010</span>
        This weekend I backed up all my data, repartitioned my hard drive, and re-installed. I needed to do this because the only thing I had on the laptop was Ubuntu, and sadly, the reality is sometimes my clients use things that require me to use Windows (and sometimes a virtual machine won&rsquo;t solve that). So now I&rsquo;m dual-booting Windows. I think the last time I did that was sometime before 2001, so I&rsquo;ve regressed 9 years.

        That&rsquo;s right, I said InnoDB+, with a &ldquo;plus&rdquo; at the end. I didn&rsquo;t know it existed until, while following some links from Monty&rsquo;s appeal to save MySQL, I decided to read a Groklaw post that links to Eben Moglen&rsquo;s letter to the EU Commission, which includes this text:
 Innobase could therefore have provided an enhanced version of InnoDB, like Oracle&rsquo;s current InnoDB+, under non-GPL license, &hellip;
 I don&rsquo;t know anything more.

        You used to use mk-query-digest to aggregate and report on MySQL&rsquo;s slow query log. Then it got the ability to grab query events from polling SHOW PROCESSLIST. Next we thought, really, how hard can it be to implement the libmysql wire protocol, so we can sniff TCP packets? &hellip; it&rsquo;s hard, but not that hard as it turns out. But why stop there, why not implement memcached protocol too? I think you can see where this is headed.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Nov 1, 2009</span>
        MySQL Proxy is a really neat tool. I remember a few years back when I first saw Jan talking about it. Back in those days it was significantly different than it is now, but the concept remains the same: direct your database traffic through a man-in-the-middle. Chris Calender&rsquo;s post on capturing erroneous queries with MySQL Proxy shows one use for Proxy. But wait. MySQL Proxy is just inspecting the MySQL protocol.

        As an alternative to another recent blog post that answered the question &ldquo;how can I truncate all the tables in my database,&rdquo; I thought I&rsquo;d show another way to do it, which does not use the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.
$ wget http://www.maatkit.org/get/mk-find $ perl mk-find --exec 'TRUNCATE TABLE %D.%N'  The other example is how to alter MyISAM tables to be InnoDB. That one&rsquo;s easy, too. Let&rsquo;s alter all MyISAM tables in the &lsquo;test&rsquo; database:

        Maatkit&rsquo;s mk-loadavg tool is a helpful way to gather information about infrequent conditions on your database server (or any other server, really). We wrote it at Percona to help with those repeated cases of things like &ldquo;every two weeks, my database stops processing queries for 30 seconds, but it&rsquo;s not locked up and during this time there is nothing happening.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s pretty much impossible to catch in action, and these conditions can take months to resolve without the aid of good tools.

 Stop Worrying and Start Monitoring with Nagios (Andrew Libby) DRBD, Network Raid, High Availability and General Awesomeness (Brian Gorka) MySQL Performance Tuning for non-DBAs (Tom Clark) Wonderful Desktop Tricks, and Aesthetics (Seth Jerome) Jump Start Django: The Web Framework for Perfectionists with Deadlines (Rob Yates) Watching and Manipulating Your Network Traffic (Josiah Ritchie)  And then of course I gave my own talk on Maatkit (slides).

Mutex spin waits 0, rounds 143359179688, OS waits 634106844 RW-shared spins 1224152309, OS waits 38278807; RW-excl spins 2432166425, OS waits 35264871 Mutex spin waits 0, rounds 143386303439, OS waits 634292093 RW-shared spins 1224197048, OS waits 38281423; RW-excl spins 2432347936, OS waits 35271423 How much have the numbers changed in the second sample?

A short time ago in a galaxy nearby, Domas Mituzas wrote about contention profiling with GDB stack traces. Mark Callaghan found the technique useful, and contributed an awk script (in the comments) to aggregate stack traces and identify which things are blocking most threads.

        Newer Linux kernels have per-process I/O accounting and you can use the iotop tool to find out what&rsquo;s performing I/O, but in many cases I&rsquo;m trying to find the source of an I/O problem in an older kernel. I found sort of a hack-ish way to do that today, while trying to figure out why a system was basically unresponsive.
I found a post on Stack Overflow that showed a way you can get per process I/O statistics from the kernel even in older kernels.

        You probably know that it&rsquo;s possible to set configuration variables to log queries that don&rsquo;t use indexes to the slow query log in MySQL. This is a good way to find tables that might need indexes.
But what if the slow query log isn&rsquo;t enabled and you are using (or consulting on) MySQL 5.0 or earlier, where it can&rsquo;t be enabled on the fly unless you&rsquo;re using a patched server such as Percona&rsquo;s enhanced builds?

So far I&rsquo;m delighted. I&rsquo;m 6-foot-4 (195cm) and this is one of the only chairs I&rsquo;ve ever seen that seats my height comfortably, both in terms of seat height and in terms of being tall enough to relax back into (the headrest extends up high enough to support my head and neck nicely).
