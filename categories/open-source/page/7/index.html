        <p>I&rsquo;ve released version 1.1.1 of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/">MySQL Cacti templates</a> I develop. The new templates work around more Cacti limitations, including the limitation on the length of the data returned from the poller script. There&rsquo;s also a new graph and many other niceties since the last release.</p>

<p><a href="https://vividcortex.com/">VividCortex</a> is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what

        I just wrote about how Maatkit has gotten some new features for helping people make sure their replicas have an exact copy of the master&rsquo;s data. This work was largely sponsored by one of Percona&rsquo;s customers, whose name I have permission to mention: Vantage Media.

Thanks Vantage! Your sponsorship helps many people and businesses.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Oct 4, 2008</span>
        <p>I have recently added some features to <a href="http://www.maatkit.org/">Maatkit&rsquo;s mk-table-checksum</a> tool that can make it easy to checksum the relevant parts of your data more frequently (i.e. <a href="http://www.drgrammar.org/faqs/#59">continually, but not continuously</a>). This in turn makes it possible for you to find out <em>much</em> sooner if a replica becomes different from its master, and then you can take action before the differences affect more of your data.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Sep 19, 2008</span>
        <p>There&rsquo;s a new release with a lot of goodies &ndash; speed, efficiency, user-friendliness, and new features. In particular some of <a href="http://www.percona.com/">Percona&rsquo;s</a> clients have sponsored features for things they need such as the ability to more frequently verify that replicas are in sync with their masters. If you need features, please ask Percona about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://hackmysql.com/">Daniel Nichter</a> has written most of the code for this release. Having a dedicated developer is really moving the project forward. Thanks Daniel!</p>

<p>If you check the issues list on the project&rsquo;s website you&rsquo;ll see we have some ambitious plans for the project, mostly driven by real-world needs from Percona&rsquo;s clients, many of whom run very large data centers and such. It makes me really happy that Maatkit is solving serious problems for which no other solution exists.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the changelog:</p>

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Aug 18, 2008</span>
        <p>Over in <a href="http://www.maatkit.org/">Maatkit</a>-land, <a href="http://hackmysql.com/">Daniel Nichter</a> and I practice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-first programming, AKA test-driven development</a>. That is, we write tests for each new feature or to catch regressions on each bug we fix. And &ndash; this is crucial &ndash; we write the tests <em>before</em> we write the code.* The tests should initially fail, which is a validation that the new code actually works and the tests actually verify this. If we don&rsquo;t first write a failing testcase, then our code lacks a very important guarantee: &ldquo;if you break this code, then the test case will tell you so.&rdquo; (A test that doesn&rsquo;t fail when the code fails isn&rsquo;t worth writing.)</p>

        Dear LazyWeb, I want to use my Ubuntu laptop (on amd64 BTW) to build an RPM of Maatkit that will work on all RPM-based distros. Is it possible? Or are there enough differences between the RPM-based distros that I can&rsquo;t do it? Mind you, the finished RPM ought to just have some man pages and Perl scripts, so I don&rsquo;t think it will be platform- or distro-specific. But I am just not an expert on it.

        Percona is looking to hire someone to develop Maatkit, among other things.
If I weren&rsquo;t having so much fun being the consulting team lead, I&rsquo;d be doing it myself. (In fact, I&rsquo;m still hacking on it a lot. Got some pretty fun stuff done this weekend.) I don&rsquo;t know what the rest of the world thinks, but I think Maatkit is a damn enjoyable project to work on. Hopefully someone else will have the same kind of mindset and want to get paid for it, unlike poor working-on-the-weekends me.

        My post on what it&rsquo;s like to write a technical book was a stream-of-consciousness look at the process of writing High Performance MySQL, Second Edition.

I want to follow up on these things.

        Before I tell you what&rsquo;s new, let me tell you how cool I think it would be if Maatkit were voted Sourceforge.net project of the year. Just something to think about :-) I suggest the &ldquo;Best Tool or Utility for SysAdmins&rdquo; category. You can actually click the Back button and nominate it for several categories. Not that anyone would do that, of course.
Also, if anyone wants to jump in and help out with bug fixes and new features, please, by all means.

        I have been using Maatkit in a different way since I joined Percona as a consultant. When I&rsquo;m working on a system now, it&rsquo;s a new, unfamiliar system &ndash; not one where I have already installed my favorite programs. And that means I want to grab my favorite productivity tools fast.
I intentionally wrote the Maatkit tools so they don&rsquo;t need to be &ldquo;installed.&rdquo; You just run them, that&rsquo;s all. But I never made them easy to download.

        **Update: ** Karanbir says &ldquo;Just one thing to keep in mind is that we dont want too many people using it from the Testing repository &#8211; we only need enough feedback to move it from testing to stable ( and to be honest, there are already 8 people who have said yes it works &#8211; so move to stable should happen within the next 24 &#8211; 48 hrs ). Once the package is in stable, users on CentOS4 and 5 wont need to do anything more than just &lsquo;yum install maatkit&rsquo; and it will install for them.

        MySQL just gave me an award at this morning&rsquo;s keynote, along with Sheeri Kritzer Cabral (for the second year in a row!) and Diego Medina, for my code contributions to the MySQL community, specifically Maatkit, which makes it easier to make MySQL reliable, fast, and robust. It&rsquo;s an honor to be recognized. And while I could leave it at that, I&rsquo;d like to say a word or two more.
The economy, community, and ecosystem that&rsquo;s building around Free Software can often be very rewarding financially.

Harrison Fisk (co-author of MySQL Clustering) got the first one, because he told me that he recommends Maatkit to MySQL Support customers about twice a week. I made sure to save one for Jay Pipes too, because his luggage got lost so he has nothing to wear.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Mar 16, 2008</span>
        Maatkit contains essential command-line utilities for MySQL, such as a table checksum tool and query profiler. It provides missing features such as checking replicas for data consistency, with emphasis on quality and scriptability.
This release contains major bug fixes and new features. Some of the changes are not backwards-compatible. It also contains new tools to help you discover replication replicas and move them around the replication hierarchy.

        This release contains minor bug fixes and new features. Besides the little bug fixes, there&rsquo;s a fun new feature in mk-heartbeat: it can auto-discover replicas recursively, and show the replication delay on all of them, to wit:
baron@keywest ~ $ mk-heartbeat --check --host master -D rkdb --recurse 10 master 0 slave1 1 slave2 1 slave3 4 (Not actual results. Your mileage may vary. Closed course, professional driver. Do not attempt).

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Jan 24, 2008</span>
        This release contains bug fixes and new features. It also contains a new tool: my implementation of Paul Tuckfield&rsquo;s relay log pipelining idea. I have had quite a few responses to that blog post, and requests for the code. So I&rsquo;m releasing it as part of Maatkit.
Changelog for mk-archiver: 2008-01-24: version 1.0.7 * Added --quiet option. * Added --plugin option. The plugin interface is not backwards compatible. * Added --bulkins option.
