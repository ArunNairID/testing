        <span class="post-date">Thu, Apr 5, 2007</span>
        I&rsquo;ve just released three updates to tools in MySQL Toolkit. The updated programs are MySQL Query Profiler (major new features and helper script), MySQL Table Sync (bug fixes, documentation, features), and MySQL Table Checksum (minor sanity check enhancement).
MySQL Query Profiler 1.1.0 I&rsquo;ve added the ability to profile more data, including an educated guess at the number of filesorts.
The tool can now profile external programs. There are several ways you can do this:

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Mar 25, 2007</span>
        I&rsquo;ve just released updates to all the tools in the MySQL Toolkit. The biggest change I made to most packages is using DBD to read MySQL&rsquo;s option files, though some packages got more significant updates.
Overview I discovered some features I didn&rsquo;t know the Perl MySQL driver had &ndash; features to read MySQL&rsquo;s option files, mostly, though there are some other nice features I use occasionally (but which are very relevant to innotop).

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Mar 19, 2007</span>
        MySQL Toolkit&rsquo;s Show Grants tool can now separate grants into individual statements, convert them into REVOKE statements, and help you remove users from a server, even if your server doesn&rsquo;t support DROP USER.
Changes The comment on my last post, combined with my need to revoke some grants today on a server that accidentally got grants replicated to it, prompted me to add more functionality to this tool. It can now:

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Mar 17, 2007</span>
        MySQL Toolkit&rsquo;s Show Grants tool makes it easy to extract grants from a MySQL server in canonical form. You can use it to replicate grants between servers, diff grants, and avoid spurious changesets in version control systems. It&rsquo;s part of the Maatkit project on Google Code.
It&rsquo;s a fairly simple tool that connects to a MySQL server, issues SHOW GRANTS, and prints the results. By default it prints grants for every user, but you can specify users to show and users to ignore.

        Now that I have innotop hosted on sourceforge, I&rsquo;d like to use the tools they provide, especially the forums and mailing lists. I&rsquo;ve set up an innotop-discuss mailing list, which I hope you&rsquo;ll find a better way to get support than posting in the comments on this blog.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Mar 3, 2007</span>
        It&rsquo;s finally ready &ndash; the new stable version of the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor. Version 1.4.0 brings you new features and enhancements I think you&rsquo;ll really enjoy:
 Manage many servers at once conveniently. Powerful filters, expressions, colorizing rules, and sorting. Better error handling. More modes, such as a mode to monitor and control replication. Much more.  Much gratitude is due the people who&rsquo;ve helped, especially Sebastien Estienne, Christian Hammers, Steven Kreuzer and other people who&rsquo;ve helped design features, make packages, get innotop distributed more widely, and give me advice on such things as Makefiles.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Feb 3, 2007</span>
        innotop 1.3.5 is the latest release of the increasingly popular MySQL and InnoDB monitor. I recommend everyone upgrade to this release. Aside from incomplete documentation, it&rsquo;s close to a stable 1.4 release (I&rsquo;m counting on you to find the bugs!). There are many significant new features since version 1.3, which make it more powerful and easier to use. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new:
 Support for colorizing rows. Default color rules are included for Q, T and M modes; it&rsquo;s easy to write your own.

        I just made a snapshot of the development branch of the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor, and released it as version 1.3.0. This code will eventually become version 1.4. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new.
Version number policy Odd-numbered releases, such as 1.3.0, contain the code that will eventually become a stable release &ndash; in this case 1.4. Not all the features are there, and not all of them work perfectly, but it&rsquo;s a development snapshot for community review and feedback.

        I've made the 1.0 release I promised yesterday, and it is available for download on the innotop project homepage. I'm now working on version 1.3, which is will become 1.4, which is on the road to version 2.0. I've added a project roadmap for versions 1.4, 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0.
Thanks to Sebastien Estienne, who is maintaining the Debian/Ubuntu innotop packages, for helping me decide how to arrange the source repository, branching and tagging practices, and more.

        A couple of weeks ago I submitted a request to open a new project on Sourceforge for the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor. I want to make it easier for others to collaborate, especially package maintainers. Yesterday I got word of its approval. I have done a quick-and-dirty import of the source code into its new home, and I&rsquo;m now continuing work on the next major version, which I&rsquo;ve been working on for about six weeks.

        It&rsquo;s been a while since I released an update to the innotop InnoDB and MySQL monitor, but I have not been idle. I&rsquo;m currently working hard to add major new features and functionality. Here&rsquo;s a quick list of what&rsquo;s coming, much of which is done already but still slightly broken:
 Arbitrary user-defined expressions can be the source of a column in a tabular view. You are not limited to choosing from the columns I&rsquo;ve defined; you can add your own, and base it directly on the available data or write an expression to calculate what you want.

        A kind soul has contributed a Debian/Ubuntu package for the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor. Thanks Sebastien Estienne!
Sebastien wrote me that he tested it on Ubuntu Dapper Drake, and I just verified that it works on Edgy Eft.
Since I use Ubuntu on my own machine now, I may integrate this into my build process for future releases of innotop. But for right now, at least there&rsquo;s another installation option.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 11, 2006</span>
        I recently tested innotop on Microsoft Windows. There was one slight glitch, but I changed a couple lines of code, and now it runs out of the box under ActivePerl. Version 0.1.156 contains those changes for Windows compatibility.
How to install I installed it under ActivePerl 5.8.8 build 819:
 Download and install ActivePerl After installation, open the Perl Package Manager from Start/Programs/ActivePerl 5.8.8 Build 819. Select Time-HiRes, DBD-mysql, and install them.

FreeBSD adds innotop to ports When this is finalized, FreeBSD users will be able to install innotop with the following commands:
cd /usr/ports/databases/innotop make all install This is great news. It makes innotop easier to find, install and use.

        I recently published an article on O&rsquo;Reilly about monitoring tools for MySQL. Of course I believe innotop is the best in its class, so I mentioned it. But I also recently added some features to innotop, and made a stability fix too.
Innotop upgrade: new features, stability Now you can easily monitor open tables with innotop. Just get the latest version (your configuration file will be upgraded seamlessly) and press the &lsquo;O&rsquo; key (that&rsquo;s capital &ldquo;oh&rdquo;).

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Sep 28, 2006</span>
        Version 0.1.152 of innotop is a small maintenance and bug-fix release. I found some more ways to make it deal with garbage input without crashing. Of course, that means it&rsquo;s harder to find errors because it doesn&rsquo;t complain and let me know they exist, but that&rsquo;s what you are for :-)
I&rsquo;m also making a sort of homepage for it. I just don&rsquo;t have much time to put into these things right now, so a &ldquo;real&rdquo; homepage may be a long time off, I don&rsquo;t know.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Sep 5, 2006</span>
        Version 0.1.149 of the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor is a major upgrade. As of this version I&rsquo;m declaring innotop &ldquo;stable,&rdquo; meaning I&rsquo;ve put some work into making it deal with unexpected input. It should be very resistant to any sort of crash now.
I originally made it intolerant of unexpected input, because the output of SHOW INNODB STATUS varies so much and was never designed for parsability. Making it die when it couldn&rsquo;t parse something let me know there was a problem, but it caused many of you pain when you couldn&rsquo;t keep it running reliably.

        I&rsquo;ve released version 0.1.146 of the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor.
I re-arranged some information to be more compact and readable in this version, but there isn&rsquo;t really much new functionality. This is mostly a bug-fix release to prevent crashes when innotop encounters unexpected information, or doesn&rsquo;t find some information it expects to exist. It&rsquo;s still very much beta software, so it may die unexpectedly. See this article about what information I need to debug and fix crashes.

        This is one in a series of articles on how to use innotop, a MySQL and InnoDB monitor. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain how innotop can make it much easier to collect useful information from SHOW STATUS and SHOW VARIABLES into one place. There are three modes in innotop that do this in different ways, so one of them may meet your needs.
 Note: VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012.

        I&rsquo;ve released another version of the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor.
It&rsquo;s worth upgrading to this version not only because of the new features, but also because it should handle more special cases without crashing. Of course, if it does crash, I appreciate your help fixing it; see this article about what information I need.
Changes since version 0.1.123 include:
 Fixes to deal with older versions of Perl. Thanks to everyone who helped me find out what was wrong.
