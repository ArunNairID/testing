        I just realized that I didn&rsquo;t publicize this in the Postgres world, or anywhere but the MySQL blogosphere for that matter. Some folks at my company have released a generic TCP-response-time tool. Very useful for monitoring, benchmarks, historical metrics, and so on. It&rsquo;s kind of like iostat, but for TCP traffic, and fully focused on time, not traffic size. Performance == time and tasks, and this is a lightweight way to measure that data.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Aug 2, 2010</span>
        OUTER JOIN queries in SQL are susceptible to two very subtle bugs that I&rsquo;ve observed a number of times in the real world. Daniel and I have been hammering out ways to automatically detect queries that suffer from these bugs, in a relatively new Maatkit tool called mk-query-advisor. It&rsquo;s part of our series of advisor tools for MySQL. I wrote a blog post about it a while ago. Automated analysis of bad query patterns is a good thing to write tools to do, because catching buggy queries is hard work if you do it manually.

        For those of you who miss what Maatkit&rsquo;s mk-audit tool (now retired) gave you, there&rsquo;s a pair of tools in Aspersa that more than replaces it. I wrote previously about the summary tool. I don&rsquo;t think I have mentioned the mysql-summary tool. It has been under development for a while, and at this point it has quite a lot of functionality. You can see a sample of the output on its manual page.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jul 3, 2010</span>
        This is the follow-up to my post on how I keep track of tasks. It&rsquo;s important for me to have a good system for keeping notes and other files organized. The problem usually turns out to be that I want them organized several different ways simultaneously: by date, by project, by person, by subject. Alas, if I keep them in files on a hard drive, I can only choose one such organizing strategy, because filesystems are a single hierarchy.

        The Maatkit article on Wikipedia was removed some time ago, after being deemed not notable. I believe this is no longer the case. It&rsquo;s hard to find a credible book published on MySQL in the last few years that doesn&rsquo;t mention Maatkit, there&rsquo;s quite a bit of blogging about it from MySQL experts and prominent community members, and the toolkit is certainly in wide use &ndash; it&rsquo;s important enough that notable companies are supporting its development.

        There&rsquo;s lots of buzz lately about the so-called &ldquo;open-core&rdquo; business model of Marten Mickos&rsquo;s new employer. But this is nothing new. Depending on how you define it, InnoDB is &ldquo;open-core,&rdquo; and has been for a long time. The InnoDB Hot Backup (ibbackup) tool was always closed-source. Did anyone ever cry foul and claim that this made InnoDB itself not open-source, or accuse Innobase / Oracle of masquerading as open-source? I don&rsquo;t recall that happening, although sometimes people got suspicious about the interplay between the backup tool and the storage engine.

        I use a super-simple system for keeping track of tasks that are mine personally to manage. I use issue-tracking systems for software projects and consulting work, but there is still a bunch of work-related and personal work that I need to make sure I don&rsquo;t forget.
The main point is not to ensure that I don&rsquo;t forget, actually. It is to be able to put it out of my mind with confidence that I won&rsquo;t lose it.

        The Maatkit toolkit for MySQL has a lot of functionality that&rsquo;s common across the tools. It&rsquo;s not a good idea to document this in each tool&rsquo;s man page, of course. So there is an overall maatkit man page. It explains concepts such as configuration file syntax. This and all the other Maatkit man pages are online.

        I wrote recently about early detection for MySQL performance problems. If your server is having micro-fluctuations in performance, it&rsquo;s important to know, because very soon they will turn much worse. What can you do about this?
The most important thing is not to guess at what&rsquo;s happening, but to measure instead. I have seen these problems from DNS, the binary log, failing hardware, the query cache, the table cache, the thread cache, and a variety of InnoDB edge cases.

        The traditional way to build Cacti templates is through the Cacti web interface. This is an enormous amount of work, and the result is generally not very consistent or good quality. The process is too error-prone. You can export the templates as XML, but they tend to have problems such as version incompatibilities with other Cacti installations, and it&rsquo;s hard to adapt them for user preferences such as different graph image sizes and polling intervals.

        I spent a little time yesterday doing some things with the &ldquo;summary&rdquo; tool from Aspersa. I added support for summarizing status and configuration of Adaptec and LSI MegaRAID controllers. I also figured out how to write a test suite for Bash scripts, so most major parts of the tool are fully tested now. I learned a lot more sed and awk this weekend.
There is really only one way to get status of Adaptec controllers (/usr/StorMan/arcconf), but the LSI controllers can be queried through multiple tools.

        These days I spend more time looking at /proc/diskstats than I do at iostat. The problem with iostat is that it lumps reads and writes together, and I want to see them separately. That&rsquo;s really important on a database server (e.g. MySQL performance analysis).
It&rsquo;s not easy to read /proc/diskstats by looking at them, though. So I usually do the following to get a nice readable table:

        I was just reading up on the syntax for index hints in MySQL, and noticed this:
 An index_name value need not be a full index name. It can be an unambiguous prefix of an index name. If a prefix is ambiguous, an error occurs. I actually prefer not to have extra &ldquo;syntactic sugar&rdquo; features such as this. It helps avoid bugs and unexpected behavior. Even if I don&rsquo;t use it intentionally, I can get bitten by it, if someone adds another index whose name has the same prefix as one that I already use:

        In a couple of recent consulting cases, I needed a tool to analyze how a log of queries accesses indexes and tables in the database, specifically, to find out which indexes are not used. I initially hacked together something similar to Daniel Nichter&rsquo;s mysqlidxchk, but using the framework provided by Maatkit, which gave me a pretty good start right out of the box. This was useful in the very tight time constraints I was under, but was not a complete solution.

        I frequently encounter MySQL servers with intermittent problems that don&rsquo;t happen when I&rsquo;m watching the server. Gathering good diagnostic data when the problem happens is a must. Aspersa includes two utilities to make this easier.
The first is called &lsquo;stalk&rsquo;. It would be called &lsquo;watch&rsquo; but that&rsquo;s already a name of a standard Unix utility. It simply watches for a condition to happen and fires off the second utility.
This second utility does most of the work.

        The May release of Maatkit included a new feature in mk-query-digest. This allows you to process queries in many pieces, write out intermediate results, and then combine the pieces in a separate step. Maybe it&rsquo;s not exactly map-reduce, but it makes a good headline.
The purpose is to enable query analysis across an arbitrarily large group of servers. Process queries on all of them, ship the results to a central place, and then combine them together.

        Some of the utilities we were adding to Maatkit really did not belong there. Yes, this included some of the functionality in the now-retired mk-audit tool. We really learned a lesson about what it&rsquo;s possible to support, design, spec, code, and test in a single tool.
I&rsquo;ve moved those tools to a new project, Aspersa. Some folks are revolting and calling it Asparagus, because apparently that&rsquo;s easier to say. Aspersa is the name of the common garden snail, which turns out to be a fascinating creature.

$ wget http://www.maatkit.org/trunk/mk-query-advisor $ perl mk-query-advisor /var/log/mysql/slow.log  By default it consumes a log file in MySQL&rsquo;s slow query log format, but it can also parse the general-log format, and if you have any other kind of log you can feed it through mk-query-digest to transform the log into something it can recognize.
