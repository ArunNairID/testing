        <span class="post-date">Sat, Aug 8, 2009</span>
        Do you test your application systematically when you upgrade or reconfigure your database server? You should! Here&rsquo;s a real (anonymized) story of what happens if you don&rsquo;t.
 When we upgraded to 5.0.62 (from 5.0.27 and 5.0.45), our code broke for queries like this:
SELECT SUM(amt) FROM daily_amt WHERE day = FROM_UNIXTIME(1222889772);
The problem here was a wrong DATE/DATETIME comparison and other bug fixes in MySQL 5.0.62; it was stricter in enforcing the comparison.

        A while ago I wrote about a tool to help make upgrades safer. Since then, we have gotten several people to help sponsor development on this tool, and a few of our customers are using it to help find problems before they upgrade their systems.
I can&rsquo;t think of a single one of the Maatkit tools that didn&rsquo;t grow out of the need for deeper insight into some part of the system.

        Maatkit version 4334 is ready for download. I see that I missed posting a release announcement about last month&rsquo;s release of Maatkit. I&rsquo;ll try to cover the important bits about the last two releases here. Daniel has been posting the release announcements to the mailing list recently, so I&rsquo;ll do a bit of copy and paste of what he said too.
We&rsquo;ve released two new tools. These are mk-upgrade and mk-log-player.

        Ryan posted an article on the MySQL Performance Blog about how to use mk-query-digest to analyze and understand your memcached usage with the same techniques you use for MySQL query analysis. This is an idea that came to me during the 2009 MySQL Conference, while talking to our friends from Schooner, who sell a memcached appliance.
It suddenly struck me that the science of memcached performance is basically nonexistent, from the standpoint of developers and architects.

Default wiki list  And here&rsquo;s the after:
Wiki with sidebar and default page  Here&rsquo;s how:
 Create a wiki page called TableOfContents, or something like that. Using normal wiki syntax, enter links and text for your table of contents. The best way to do this is to use bulleted lists to organize and outline the pages.

        My brother sent me these thoughts, slightly edited:
 Recently I looked at the [Wikipedia] Linux page. To my surprise it&rsquo;s not about the kernel Linux, it&rsquo;s about the &ldquo;OS&rdquo;. I looked at discussion and it appears that by general consensus the term Linux applies to the unix like operating system, and so it is correct for Wikipedia to follow that consensus. So, instead of providing information, they are deliberately misleading folks&hellip; Often what the majority does is wrong because the majority of people are not the experts.

        Suppose that you&rsquo;re writing a new Maatkit tool (just a random example, really) and its job is to measure the difference in execution of queries. The simplest metric is execution time.
Now suppose that you&rsquo;re trying to figure out a metric of badness. The query executes in a second on machine 1 and 1000 seconds on machine 2. That&rsquo;s a pretty bad change. How do you quantify this?
Now you&rsquo;ve got a query that executes in 1ms on machine 1, and 10ms on machine 2.

        I&rsquo;ve decided to start writing a book about Maatkit. The working title is Using Maatkit. The goal is to provide another angle onto the tools; the docs are quite good in my opinion, but they only say what the tools do. The book will tell you how to use the toolkit to accomplish tasks.
I have no clue when it&rsquo;ll be done. There is no schedule. At the current rate, it&rsquo;ll take a while.

        One of the minor things I&rsquo;ve noticed when I use Thunderbird on my IMAP accounts is that it doesn&rsquo;t download IMAP messages until I click on them. Then I have to wait until I can see the message. I have heard that this is supposed to be fixed in Thunderbird 3, and I tried it but a lot of the extensions I need aren&rsquo;t compatible with it.
Today I finally tried to search and find out more about the problem.

 VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers MySQL performance monitoring and PostgreSQL performance management among many other features.

        As I was driving with a colleague in California a couple of weeks ago during the conference, the topic of conversation turned to the notion that Percona and the rest of the MySQL community really need the presence of a central entity that provides a recognized home for the MySQL server. The conversation went something like &ldquo;I was talking to so-and-so, and he said, you know, you guys really need Sun/MySQL, because without the mother ship, things will fall apart and your own business will fail.

        Maatkit version 3519 is ready for download. There are a lot of changes in this release, many of which are incompatible with previous releases. There are also a lot of important new features. Read on for the details.
First, thanks to everyone who contributed to this month&rsquo;s release. A lot of people have jumped into Maatkit and started committing code. I attribute this to deliberately forcing a more open policy with decisions being made on the mailing list, rather than the former policy of &ldquo;Percona pays for development, so they have more say than you do&rdquo; &ndash; a snobby and ill-advised way to treat an open-source project.

        Domas Mituzas mentioned this recently. It&rsquo;s so cool I just have to write about it. Here&rsquo;s an easy command to fork off a bunch of jobs in parallel: xargs.
seq 10 20 | xargs -n 1 -P 5 sleep This will send a sequence of numbers to xargs, which will divide it into chunks of one argument at a time and fork off 5 parallel processes to execute each. You can see it in action:

        At the MySQL conference, a person who used to hold an important position in an important sales organization told us something like the following: &ldquo;You know, you guys at Percona are great, but you have a big problem. You don&rsquo;t have any $500,000 customers who only file one support incident per year. Those customers are where you can really make big money.&rdquo;
We were well aware of the investigations this person did into which customers are the most profitable, and we had decided a long time ago that chasing huge sales without delivering matching services is flawed.

        I&rsquo;m presenting about Maatkit, the toolkit I created to make life better with MySQL, at the MySQL conference next week.
I&rsquo;m going to give you a whirlwind tour through some of Maatkit&rsquo;s features and functionality. The toolkit is much too large and complex to cover more than a small part of it in depth. So here is your advance warning: I&rsquo;m going to go through a lot of material, and I won&rsquo;t be stopping for lengthy discussions :-) The Maatkit documentation is very thorough, and I hope to introduce you to things that could be of use to you, so you can go learn about those topics from the documentation.

        This is really cool. I just learned this: you can treat a Perl variable just like a filehandle (read, write, etc).
my $buffer = ""; open my $fh, "", \$buffer or die $OS_ERROR; print $fh "hello, world\n";  Now $buffer contains &ldquo;hello, world\n&rdquo;. You can do the same kinds of things when reading from a variable.
I knew you could do it with IO::Scalar, but while refreshing my memory on that, I stumbled upon this &ndash; who needs IO::Scalar anymore?

        I always say that the ultimate MySQL tuning script is an expert human. To that end, I generally try to build tools that help a human be more productive with the raw information from MySQL. One of the things we look at during a performance audit is the MySQL status counters. It&rsquo;s useful to look at a) absolute values and b) several incremental snapshots. I&rsquo;ve written a small shell script called &ldquo;mext&rdquo; that can make this a little easier.
