        <span class="post-date">Sun, Nov 4, 2007</span>
        This release fixes some minor bugs. It also adds a few major new features to several of the tools. The command-line option and help functionality, as well as several other pieces of common functionality, has been replaced with common modules that have a test suite. This is the first step towards a gradual rewrite to replace untested &lsquo;script&rsquo; code with tested, maintainable code.
Changelog for mysql-archiver: 2007-11-04: version 1.0.2 * Made command-line help easier to use.

        This release of MySQL Toolkit updates MySQL Parallel Dump. Together you and I found a few bugs in it (table locking, argument quoting, exit status code). The restore utility is in progress.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Oct 5, 2007</span>
        MySQL Toolkit version numbers are based on Subversion revision number. This release is the first past the 1,000-commit milestone. It also marks several days of being in Sourceforge&rsquo;s top 100 most active projects. It has been in the top 300 for a couple of months, and the top 1000 for, um, a long time. While I would hasten to say I&rsquo;m not a popularity-contest-focused person, it&rsquo;s rewarding to see that people think this project is important and useful.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 3, 2007</span>
        This release of MySQL Toolkit fixes some minor bugs, and adds major new functionality to MySQL Parallel Dump.
Big News: MySQL Parallel Dump I wrote a lot more tests and cleaned up MySQL Parallel Dump a lot (fixed bugs with failed dumps not being reported, for instance) but the really big news is I added chunking functionality to it. Now you can say
mysql-parallel-dump --chunksize 100000 and it will try to divide each table into chunks with 100,000 rows each.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Oct 1, 2007</span>
        This release of MySQL Toolkit adds a new tool, fixes some minor bugs, and adds new functionality to one of the helper scripts.
New tool: MySQL Parallel Dump I wrote an introduction to MySQL Parallel Dump yesterday. It&rsquo;s a much smarter way to dump your data if you have a lot of it, and it&rsquo;s actually a very usable lightweight multi-threaded backup tool (it can do most dump-oriented backup jobs without a wrapper script, in my opinion).

        This release of MySQL Toolkit adds a new tool, fixes some minor bugs, and adds new functionality to several of the tools.
New tool: MySQL Heartbeat This tool was contributed by Proven Scaling&rsquo;s Jeremy Cole and Six Apart. It measures replication delay on a replica, which can be daisy-chained to any depth. It does not rely on SHOW SLAVE STATUS, and in fact it doesn&rsquo;t even need the replica processes to be running.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Sep 18, 2007</span>
        This release is part of the unstable 1.5 branch. Its features will ultimately go into the stable 1.6 branch. You can download it from the innotop-devel package.
 Note: VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production. VividCortex offers MySQL performance monitoring and PostgreSQL performance management among many other features.
 The major change is I&rsquo;ve ripped out the W (Lock Waits) mode and enabled innotop to discover not only what a transaction is waiting for, but what it holds too.

        Version 1.5.0 of the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor is out. This release is the first in the unstable 1.5.0 branch, which will eventually become the stable 1.6 branch. I'm beginning to merge the various branches I've made to support some of our needs at my employer. This first release adds some major new features and prepares for some other large improvements and new features.

        This release of MySQL Toolkit fixes some minor bugs and adds new functionality to four of the tools. Some of the changes I made were in response to feedback I got at the recent MySQL Camp. I&rsquo;m still working on some of the feature requests, such as daemon-izing certain tools.
For those who requested features for MySQL Query Profiler, the tab-separated format should give you the desired output: no zero rows, and variables are not renamed.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Aug 24, 2007</span>
        I&rsquo;ve just released changes to all tools in MySQL Toolkit. The biggest changes are in MySQL Table Sync, which I&rsquo;m beginning to give sane defaults and options to. Some of the changes are incompatible (but that&rsquo;s what you get with MySQL Table Sync, which is still very rough). I also found and fixed some bugs with MySQL Visual Explain. Thanks to everyone who submitted bug reports.
Note, the formatting overflow in MySQL Query Profiler was not a security vulnerability.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Jul 20, 2007</span>
        I&rsquo;ve just released changes to two of the tools in MySQL Toolkit. MySQL Table Checksum got some convenient functionality to help you recursively check replicas for bad replicated checksum chunks. MySQL Archiver got statistics-gathering functionality to help you optimize your archiving and purging jobs, plus a few important bug fixes.
Changes in MySQL Archiver:
 Made &#8211;time suffix optional. Added &#8211;statistics option to gather and print timing statistics. Added signal handling so mysql-archiver exits cleanly when it can.

        Version 1.4.3 of the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor is out. This release fixes some minor bugs and feature annoyances, and at last innotop has thorough documentation, available online!
What&rsquo;s new Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new:
 Added standard &#8211;version command-line option Changed colors to cyan instead of blue; more visible on dark terminals. Added information to the filter-choosing dialog. Added column auto-completion when entering a filter expression. Changed Term::ReadKey from optional to mandatory.

        MySQL Toolkit distribution 620 updates documentation and test suites, includes some major bug fixes and functionality changes, and adds one new tool to the toolkit. This article is mostly a changelog, with some added notes.
Many of the tools have matured and I just needed to make the documentation top-notch, but there&rsquo;s still a lot to be done on the crucial checksumming and syncing tools. Time is in short supply for me right now, though.

        It&rsquo;s finally here: a single-file download for all the tools in MySQL Toolkit. During this process I also upgraded every package in the toolkit to a new release, combining new versioning and some simple non-functional changes with (mostly minor) changes I&rsquo;d committed but not yet released. Details are at the end of this post.
I ended up not using a Makefile for the build process, because I wanted to it to be more auto-magical than I know how to do with a Makefile.

        Since starting the innotop and mysqltoolkit projects on Sourceforge, I have learned a lot about how to use source control more effectively &ndash; especially how branching and tagging can be used. Still, I have limited experience. I want to package all the tools in MySQL Toolkit together and release them in one archive, but I don&rsquo;t know the best way to do it; every idea seems to have drawbacks.

        This release of the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor is a major upgrade in terms of functionality, code quality, and interface consistency.

Major changes  Quick-filters to easily filter any column in any display Compatibility with MySQL 3.23 through 6.0 Improved error handling when a server is down, permissions denied, etc Use additional SHOW INNODB STATUS information in 5.

        I&rsquo;ll present a session on the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitoring tool at 2007 MySQL Conference and Expo in a couple of weeks.
The innotop session will focus on using innotop&rsquo;s basic and intermediate-level features. I&rsquo;ll demonstrate how to install it and get the initial configuration set up. I&rsquo;ll show you what innotop is good at doing, and how to do some of the things I do frequently, such as watch queries, check replication status, and look at what transactions are currently open.
