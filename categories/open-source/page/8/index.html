        Maatkit contains essential command-line utilities for MySQL, such as a table checksum tool and query profiler. It provides missing features such as checking replicas for data consistency, with emphasis on quality and scriptability.
This release contains bug fixes and new features.
Changelog for mk-archiver: 2008-01-05: version 1.0.6 * Made suffixes for time options optional (bug #1858696). Changelog for mk-deadlock-logger: 2008-01-05: version 1.0.8 * Made suffixes for time options optional (bug #1858696).

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 5, 2008</span>
        My posts lately have been mostly progress reports and release notices. That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re in the home stretch on the book, and I don&rsquo;t have much spare time. However, a lot has also been changing with Maatkit, and I wanted to take some time to write about it properly. I&rsquo;ll just write about each tool in no particular order.
Overall I&rsquo;ve been fixing a fair number of bugs, most of which have been in the code for a while.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 27, 2007</span>
        This release contains bug fixes and new features. The biggest new feature, in my opinion, is a new sync algorithm for mk-table-sync. Now you can sync any table with an index more efficiently than previously. This is the return of the speed I promised earlier. (Though I haven&rsquo;t yet benchmarked it; I am very short on time these days. Your benchmarks and other contributions are welcome).
I&rsquo;m finally feeling like the table sync tool is getting in good shape!

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Dec 16, 2007</span>
        This release fixes a few bugs, adds minor features, and adds some debugging support to shared code. I&rsquo;m working on the Nibble sync algorithm for mk-table-sync, and someone has found a few more bugs with mk-parallel-dump, but those might take me a while to complete.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Dec 8, 2007</span>
        Sheeri wrote a post (now a 404 error) referring to Maatkit on Ohloh, which I have never heard of before. I took a look at what Ohloh thinks about Maatkit. It&rsquo;s kind of neat. Beyond just the obvious &ldquo;social website&rdquo; stuff that&rsquo;s all the rage these days, it actually looks at the project&rsquo;s SVN history, analyzes the codebase, and so on.
It also estimates 8 person-years of work have gone into the project, and says that at $55,000/year it would cost $450,702 to write the code as it currently exists, which is kind of funny.

        Thanks again to all the great sponsors for my week of work on the kit!
This is the long-awaited &ldquo;Baron worked on table sync&rdquo; release. Hooray!
I have resolved all of the issues I was facing in getting a release out the door. I now have individual test suites on all the programs in the kit (some of them trivial, some not) as well as a comprehensive unit test suite on the shared code.

        This is the last day I&rsquo;m taking off work to hack on mk-table-sync, and I thought it was time for (yet another) progress report. Here&rsquo;s what I have done so far:
 All the code, except for a tiny bit of &ldquo;glue&rdquo; and &ldquo;setup&rdquo; code, is in modules. Lots more tests for the modules. A new sync algorithm (I still haven&rsquo;t rewritten the top-down and bottom-up, which are designed for network efficiency more than MySQL efficiency, and are very complicated).

        &hellip; I didn&rsquo;t get two-way sync done, and I didn&rsquo;t get the Nibble algorithm done. That much I expected. But I also didn&rsquo;t get the current work released tonight because I&rsquo;m paranoid about breaking things. I&rsquo;m trying to go through all the tools and write at least a basic test for them to be sure they can do the simplest &ldquo;unit of work&rdquo; (such as mk-find running and printing out that it finds the mysql.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 3, 2007</span>
        Ironically, the Stream algorithm I wrote as the simplest possible syncing algorithm does what the much more efficient algorithm I wrote some time ago can&rsquo;t do: sync a table without a primary key, as long as there are no duplicate rows. In fact, it&rsquo;s so dumb, it will happily sync any table, even if there are no indexes.
The flash of inspiration I had on Friday has turned out to be good insight.

        My initial plans got waylaid! I didn&rsquo;t pull out the checksumming code first, because the code wasn&rsquo;t at all as I remembered it. Instead, I began writing code to handle the more abstract problem of accepting two sets of rows, finding the differences, and doing something with them. I&rsquo;m ending up with a little more complicated system than I thought I would. However, it&rsquo;s also significantly simpler in some ways. Instead of just passing references to subroutines to use as callbacks, I&rsquo;m object-ifying the entire synchronization concept.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Nov 29, 2007</span>
        Tomorrow is the first of five days I will spend working on mk-table-sync, the data synchronization tool I developed as part of Maatkit. The first thing I&rsquo;ll do is pull the row-checksumming code out into a module and write a unit test suite for it. I&rsquo;ll probably add the code to the module that does checksums for mk-table-checksum, since it is not all that different.
My mind is not fresh on the code, but I think the next thing after that will be to pull out the code that finds differences in two sets of rows.

        A while ago I asked for people and/or organizations to sponsor development on Maatkit (formerly MySQL Toolkit) so I could take a week off work and improve the Table Sync tool. I asked for $2500 USD, but several companies have graciously offered to cover that and then some.
I&rsquo;m very happy about this, as it will allow me to dedicate a solid week to fixing bugs and adding features. There&rsquo;s a lot of demand for the tools, and there are a dozen or so bug reports unresolved for the table-sync tool, which I personally want to fix as much as anyone.

        I am so lucky I married an archaeologist.
Choosing a new name for MySQL Toolkit has been a hassle. I wanted to avoid a literal name, such as, um, MySQL Toolkit. Short is good. And so on, and so on. All the while, the Phoenix/Firebird/Firefox naming debacle was in my thoughts. I only want to do this once.
At first I tried not to stray too much from the current name.

        Maatkit (formerly MySQL Toolkit) has for some time been released both as a bundle, and as individual tools. It&rsquo;s too much work to maintain the individual packages, and I don&rsquo;t think it really benefits anyone much, if at all. While the tools will still be versioned separately, I&rsquo;m going to discontinue releases of the individual packages, and just release the one uber-package from now on.
This will also make it easier for me to manage the name change, but that&rsquo;s just an extra incentive; I&rsquo;ve been considering this for a while.

        This release fixes several bugs introduced in the last release as I replaced untested code with tested code &ndash; how ironic! Actually, I knew that was virtually guaranteed to happen. Anyway, all the bugs you&rsquo;ve helped me find are now fixed. I also fixed a long-standing bug in MySQL Table Sync, which I am otherwise trying to touch as little as possible for the time being.

        The 1.5.2 release of innotop contained two bugs, one very minor. The other was a crash because of the new functionality that aggregates results across many connections. I fixed them and released version 1.6.0, which I consider stable and ready for everyone to use. (My version naming convention for innotop is that even-numbered minor versions are for production use; odd-numbered, such as 1.5.2, are the development branch. That&rsquo;s why I release them under the innotop-devel package).

        Yep, it&rsquo;s true. &ldquo;MySQL Toolkit&rdquo; technically infringes on MySQL&rsquo;s trademark. I haven&rsquo;t been given a mandate or cease-and-desist order or anything, but as Marten Mickos (MySQL&rsquo;s CEO) told me, anything that starts with the word &ldquo;MySQL&rdquo; sounds like it comes from the company, and this project doesn&rsquo;t come from MySQL.
Suggestions are welcome. I&rsquo;m totally uninspired. &ldquo;Toolkit&rdquo; was the best I could do when I named the project to begin with.

        Si Chen wrote recently about the growth limits of open-source projects. He points out that as a project becomes larger, it gets harder to maintain. I can only agree. As the MySQL Toolkit project has grown, it&rsquo;s become significantly more work to maintain, document, and enhance. (This is why I&rsquo;m asking you to sponsor me for a week off my regular job to work on MySQL Table Sync, by the way.
