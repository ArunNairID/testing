        <p>In <a href="/blog/2013/07/10/ultimate-notebook-and-journal-face-off/">The Ultimate Notebook</a>,
I reviewed a large list of notebooks I bought in my quest for the perfect one
for me. (I&rsquo;m happy to say that I&rsquo;ve been using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0072WW8K4/?tag=xaprb-20">Quo Vadis Habana in Raspberry</a> exclusively
for a while). But what about the perfect pen? Ah, pens. As much a personal
matter as notebooks are. I&rsquo;ve tried a variety of pens. Here&rsquo;s my review of some
of them.</p>

<p>I recently updated the <a href="http://www.highperfmysql.com">High Performance MySQL</a>
website to modernize it. I am impressed at how easy it is these days to get a
great little brochure site hosted. It used to be a lot more work. I used a
variety of tools and services to do this and decided to share this for people
who are interested. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll add comments and point me towards more
tools and tips to make these things even easier for me in the future!</p>

        <p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you spend so much time typing on a computer that a good notebook or journal is one of life&rsquo;s finer pleasures. I&rsquo;ve kept a diary of my personal life for close to 30 years now, and I have a shelf full of journals. I&rsquo;ve found a great many that I enjoy writing in, and choosing a different one each time is part of the fun.</p>

<p>But thus far, my quest for a notepad has been unsatisfying. Many notepads have loved me, but I&rsquo;m sorry to say their love has been unrequited. I&rsquo;ve tried all the usual things: Moleskine, loose-leaf paper, binders, what have you. But I never found something that is practical, functional, a joy to write on, and a pleasure to look at and hold. I just can&rsquo;t settle into a long-term relationship with my notebook, because I haven&rsquo;t met The Right One yet.</p>

        The second edition of High Performance MySQL has 27 reviews on Amazon, but the third edition only has 5 so far. By this point I assume many of you have a copy and have read it cover to cover. I&rsquo;d really appreciate your reviews &ndash; when purchasing, people look not only at the star rating but at the number of reviews. You can create a review here. And thanks!

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Feb 16, 2012</span>
        O&rsquo;Reilly isn&rsquo;t the only excellent tech publisher, but they&rsquo;re the one whose books most consistently give me pleasure to read. After going through the process of writing two books with them, one of the things that&rsquo;s struck me is how much they invest into the thankless tasks such as indexing, proofreading, and copyediting their authors&rsquo; work.
There are probably many steps in the production process &ndash; what happens after the author &ldquo;finishes&rdquo; the book &ndash; that I know nothing about.

Eric Bergen called the second edition &ldquo;the best MySQL book on the planet&rdquo;. What will the third edition be called? The best in the solar system? This reminds me of a joke, supposed to be a true story: three pizza restaurants next to each other had signs saying &ldquo;best pizza in town,&rdquo; &ldquo;best pizza in the world,&rdquo; and &ldquo;best pizza on this block.

        The third edition is nearly done. I&rsquo;ve committed first drafts of all chapters, and all but one appendix. I need to do the last appendix and then rewrite the preface, which is a few days of work at my current pace. After that, it&rsquo;s the usual tech review, copyediting, updates to figures, etc &ndash; and then it&rsquo;s off to production.
I&rsquo;m really pleased with this edition. I was planning on it just being a refresh of the second edition to reflect what&rsquo;s new in MySQL-land, but it&rsquo;s almost a complete rewrite.

        A few people have asked me how it&rsquo;s going, so I thought I&rsquo;d just share it with everyone. Things are going great. I&rsquo;m writing much more quickly than I thought I would be, and as a result I&rsquo;m finding I have time to do more changes than I thought I could, which makes me happy. I should be finished drafting the chapters by the end of the year.
In particular, the faster than expected pace is giving me a chance to address one of the big weaknesses of the second edition.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Sep 14, 2011</span>
        I have just signed the contract for High Performance MySQL, Third Edition. The third edition will include major updates and new content in these areas:
 Recent performance and reliability advances, particularly in MySQL 5.5 and the InnoDB storage engine. A new chapter on using MySQL in cloud computing environments. Updates on modern hardware, including many CPUs, large memory, and solid-state storage. Improvements in clustering and high availability, including middleware and third-party solutions.

        O&rsquo;Reilly tells me that translation rights for our book, High Performance MySQL Second Edition have been purchased in the following languages:
 Korean Russian Portuguese Polish Spanish Czech  Some of them were sold quite a while ago, and some are more recent. Portuguese was the first. I&rsquo;m looking forward to learning all these languages (except for Spanish, which I already sort of know) so I can read the book in them&hellip; in my copious spare time!

        I just thought I&rsquo;d drop a line about our book. Sales appear to be doing well still: the book is still at Amazon sales rank 3,213 and seems to hold pretty steady there. A lot of people have discovered it and are recommending it &ndash; including members of MySQL&rsquo;s professional services team. There are several positive reviews on Amazon (though if you like the book, a few more wouldn&rsquo;t hurt either).

        Apparently High Performance MySQL, 2nd Edition is selling quite well &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how well &ndash; because we&rsquo;re preparing for a second printing. This makes me very happy. I don&rsquo;t think they anticipated going back to the press for quite some time.
The book fluctuates between sales rank 1000 and 2000 on Amazon during the day, and has reached as high as 600 or so. This is just phenomenal.

        The book is done now, right? What&rsquo;s next?
Don&rsquo;t tell my wife this, but a book is never done.
Right now I&rsquo;m proofreading the printed copy. I proofread PDF after PDF during production, but some problems will always slip through and make it to paper. I&rsquo;m finding quite a few little mistakes. For example, at one point we refer to TPC as TCP three times in a row. Oops.
These problems will be corrected in the next printing.

        My post on what it&rsquo;s like to write a technical book was a stream-of-consciousness look at the process of writing High Performance MySQL, Second Edition. I got a lot of responses from it and learned some neat things I wouldn&rsquo;t have learned if I hadn&rsquo;t written the post. I also got a lot of questions, and my editor wrote a response too. I want to follow up on these things.

        Update, almost a year later: Take this with a grain of salt. I wrote it after an incredible marathon of staying up most of the night for months on end. My take on it now that I have some distance from the project is -- I'd definitely work with Andy Oram and O'Reilly again, and I'd be able to make the process a lot easier for myself the second time.
