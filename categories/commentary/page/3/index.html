        <span class="post-date">Wed, Jun 30, 2010</span>
        I use a super-simple system for keeping track of tasks that are mine personally to manage. I use issue-tracking systems for software projects and consulting work, but there is still a bunch of work-related and personal work that I need to make sure I don&rsquo;t forget.
The main point is not to ensure that I don&rsquo;t forget, actually. It is to be able to put it out of my mind with confidence that I won&rsquo;t lose it.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jun 12, 2010</span>
        Dr. Richard Hipp gave a talk at Southeast Linux Fest today on choosing an open-source database. He thinks that NoSQL is not a very good name for the new databases we&rsquo;re seeing these days, so he proposed a new name: postmodern databases. Why postmodern?
 The absence of objective truth Queries return opinions, not facts  I thought this was the best proposal I&rsquo;ve heard for an alternative to the NoSQL moniker.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, May 10, 2010</span>
        A lot of conversations with a few different people I respect (no links, sorry) have coalesced some thoughts about these newly popular &ldquo;non-relational&rdquo; datastores. I wanted to point out an aspect I&rsquo;m not sure is very clear in the hot-topic department. This is about what happens when managers learn that their developers or operations team have installed some new technology in their systems without them knowing it.
Lest anyone think that this happens only in a poorly-managed company, I can attest that it happens everywhere, all the time.

        A now-famous quote that I probably don&rsquo;t need to attribute: &ldquo;First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.&rdquo;
Where is Drizzle in this lifecycle? I&rsquo;ve been hearing and reading some comments to the tune of &ldquo;those Drizzle guys think it&rsquo;s easy to rip MySQL stuff out and start over, wait till they see how hard it&rsquo;s going to get when the real world sinks in.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Apr 21, 2010</span>
        Much has been made of certain limitations of MySQL&rsquo;s query optimizer (&ldquo;planner&rdquo;). Subqueries, lack of sort-merge joins, and so on. This is not MySQL-bashing and no one should be offended. Some people have worked to make things better, and that code is in branches that were intended for future releases. But if that work were available right now, would you trust it?
This question is important because the optimizer is complex and full of compromises and black magic.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Apr 18, 2010</span>
        I got a couple of questions and comments about OpenSQL Camp in the past week, and I thought it would be worth noting down the history, because I think there is some difference in perception and memory about this series of events. The following is only my point of view.
What is OpenSQL Camp? I can say what I had in mind when I created the original event, but this is bigger than me, so I don&rsquo;t get to dictate anything.

        Brian got interviewed by O&rsquo;Relly recently, and part of it quoted him as saying this:
 When everything doesn&rsquo;t fit onto a computer, you have to be able to migrate data to multiple nodes. You need some sort of scaling solution there&hellip; MapReduce works as a solution when your queries are operating over a lot of data; Google sizes of data. Few companies have Google-sized datasets though. The average sites you see, they&rsquo;re 10-20 gigs of data.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Mar 8, 2010</span>
        It seems that a lot of people equate non-SQL databases with non-relational-ness, or malign the word relational. This is pretty much pure ignorance. If you&rsquo;ve ever uttered a sentence that includes the phrase &ldquo;&hellip;non-relational database&hellip;&rdquo; then I have two suggestions for you.
 Study relational algebra. At a bare minimum, read the Wikipedia article on relational algebra. There is much more you could do &ndash; take a class on the topic, or read C.

        Which is better? I don&rsquo;t know, because I&rsquo;m a Vim user, so it&rsquo;s a moot point for me. But I have not noticed any Emacs-style keyboard shortcuts on websites. To the contrary, it seems like everything is Vim-style &ndash; certainly most Google apps are Vim-ish, and even Firefox is Vim-ish (press the / key to start searching for text on the page). Based on this highly scientific criterion, I declare Vim the winner.

        Cary Millsap has a concise, readable paper on performance. Anyone involved in database performance optimization should read it. Cary&rsquo;s writing has heavily influenced the mk-query-digest tool for analyzing MySQL/PostgreSQL/Memcached/HTTP query performance, and I think you&rsquo;ll get a lot more from mk-query-digest if you read this paper &ndash; and you should also read his book, reviewed here. It&rsquo;s one of the top books on my Essential Books List.

        InfiniDB has a sensible Enterprise/Community release process, which seems similar to what I suggested for MySQL. Its simplicity also stands in stark contrast to MySQL&rsquo;s new release policy, which is hard to understand and has been confusing people.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 14, 2009</span>
        One of MySQL&rsquo;s notable projects was splitting the product into two editions: Enterprise Edition and Community Edition. This move alienated many in the community, and failed to create meaningful differentiation on either side, even with a team of people beating the community bushes for &ldquo;contributions.&rdquo; The net differentiation was ultimately Jeremy Cole&rsquo;s SHOW PROFILES functionality, which made Community better than Enterprise. Sun put less effort into making this split work, and eventually they abandoned it.

        Ever been around a group of people discussing some technology and heard Cool-Whip phrases like this?
 It&rsquo;s not about MySQL versus PostgreSQL, it&rsquo;s about using the right tool for the job.
 Or how about this one?
 You need to take the important factors into account before you decide whether [hot new fad] or [trusty old solution] is best suited for your application.
 Both are signs that someone might be trying to sound important.

        My Dell laptop&rsquo;s battery died (slowly). Thinking I was being clever, I bought a replacement part from a name brand instead of Dell. That one died, too, but much more spectacularly. If I buy another battery, this time from Dell, I&rsquo;ll have spent more on batteries than on the laptop.
This stinks. It&rsquo;s all around us, though: refrigerators that have non-serviceable compressors, so when they wear out you have to get a new refrigerator.

        A friend of mine works for a company that&rsquo;s starting a place called OpenSpace. They did a funny YouTube ad for it. If you work from home, give it a look &ndash; it brought a smile to my face. I love the &ldquo;trying to write on a whiteboard way down low&rdquo; thing. That is pretty much the norm for me, because I&rsquo;m tall. They are hoping for viral marketing to help OpenSpace succeed.

        If you don&rsquo;t like DRM (Digital Restrictions Management), there are lots of ways to protest it. One of the simplest and most effective is to pick a massively popular DRM&rsquo;ed device, and express your dismay to the manufacturer and users. Here&rsquo;s an idea:
 Browse to the DRM-laden Amazon Kindle&rsquo;s product page. Look for reviews that mention the problems with its DRM. Mark them as helpful.  Here is a selection of such reviews, in which the reviewers rightly protest the restrictions, even though some of them are not really educated about DRM per se:

 Recently I looked at the [Wikipedia] Linux page. To my surprise it&rsquo;s not about the kernel Linux, it&rsquo;s about the &ldquo;OS&rdquo;. I looked at discussion and it appears that by general consensus the term Linux applies to the unix like operating system, and so it is correct for Wikipedia to follow that consensus. So, instead of providing information, they are deliberately misleading folks&hellip; Often what the majority does is wrong because the majority of people are not the experts.
