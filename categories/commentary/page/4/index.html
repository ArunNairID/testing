        <span class="post-date">Fri, May 8, 2009</span>
        In the past I have taken a somewhat neutral stance on the non-Free nature of the MySQL documentation, but after the recent discussion about it I&rsquo;ve reconsidered. I have changed my position; now I see the restrictions on the documentation as a serious problem for the community and partner ecosystem.
The arguments I&rsquo;ve heard in favor of keeping the documentation non-Free do not hold up well when you shine a bright light on them, in my opinion.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, May 5, 2009</span>
        As I was driving with a colleague in California a couple of weeks ago during the conference, the topic of conversation turned to the notion that Percona and the rest of the MySQL community really need the presence of a central entity that provides a recognized home for the MySQL server. The conversation went something like &ldquo;I was talking to so-and-so, and he said, you know, you guys really need Sun/MySQL, because without the mother ship, things will fall apart and your own business will fail.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Apr 29, 2009</span>
        At the MySQL conference, a person who used to hold an important position in an important sales organization told us something like the following: &ldquo;You know, you guys at Percona are great, but you have a big problem. You don&rsquo;t have any $500,000 customers who only file one support incident per year. Those customers are where you can really make big money.&rdquo;
We were well aware of the investigations this person did into which customers are the most profitable, and we had decided a long time ago that chasing huge sales without delivering matching services is flawed.

        How Life Imitates Chess, by Garry Kasparov, 2008. 204 pages.
I've been wanting to write a review of this book for a while. I forget now exactly when I got it, but I have greatly enjoyed reading it. I have read it several times. It's a book on decision making (it's not really a book about chess) from a man who's Russian (which matters because I work with many Russians), a master of decision making, and not least of all -- he has taken on the world's toughest opponents and continues to do so today.

        I really like Dokuwiki. I remember looking at it many years ago (even then, there were way too many wikis) but for some reason my company or project at the time didn&rsquo;t choose it. Maybe this was the company that decided Sharepoint was better, I don&rsquo;t remember. (They never did understand why a collection of Word documents was inferior to a wiki.)
I&rsquo;ve been using it for a while now, and of all the wikis I&rsquo;ve used, which are quite a few, it is easily the nicest.

        What&rsquo;s going on at your favorite open-source database developer mailing list? Non-scientific memory of what I&rsquo;ve been seeing lately:
 The Drizzle list is talking about test coverage and completeness, and schedulers. The MySQL internals list has recently been dominated with talk about coding standards. The PostgreSQL hackers list is talking about a ton of stuff. I don&rsquo;t even try to keep up. The Percona launchpad list is talking about bugs, xtrabackup, and more bugs and patches for them.

        My employer has been looking for a company who can provide us with phone service designed for a decentralized, virtual-office consulting and support workforce, and after extensive surveying of the options, every single one comes up short on features, quality, or support. You can have one or sometimes two, but not all three, and we don&rsquo;t really see signs of it getting better. There&rsquo;s a real race to the bottom in this industry.

        Sourceforge has reintroduced persistent login cookies. Here&rsquo;s the bug request I submitted about this, a long time ago.
The thing is, I don&rsquo;t really care much anymore. I&rsquo;ve moved my open-source projects off Sourceforge onto Google Code. I am about 10x more productive there.
This lesson can be applied to pretty much everything on the web these days. Make it even the slightest bit hard to use your service, and people will use what&rsquo;s easy instead.

There&rsquo;s a handy iCal download of the conference schedule on the conference website. iCal is a plain text format that is easy to parse with a scripting language. I downloaded this year&rsquo;s and last year&rsquo;s schedules, and aggregated the number of times each company and speaker is listed as presenting a session.

        I&rsquo;ve been going through some old stuff that got thrown into a big cardboard box during my move in September. In particular there are a lot of papers from my desk &ndash; old notes I&rsquo;d scratched down, legal pads full of notes taken during phone conversations, and so on.
Reading through these old conversations brings them back to me. There are notes from my first &ldquo;non-interview&rdquo; with Alan Rimm-Kaufman of The Rimm-Kaufman Group.

        It&rsquo;s a new year, and Free Software is more ubiquitous and important than ever. At the same time, the work is far from over. Here&rsquo;s something inspiring you can read to stimulate some deep thoughts about the nature of Free Software: an essay from 1958, &ldquo;I, Pencil.&rdquo;
I first read this essay at my father&rsquo;s suggestion, long before I was involved with computers. He told me it was the best defense of free enterprise and free markets that he&rsquo;d ever read.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Dec 23, 2008</span>
        I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the business of what&rsquo;s variously come to be called commercial open-source and enterprise open-source. I&rsquo;m interested in the gestalt &ndash; the product, development processes, marketing, licensing and so on.
MySQL has tried many different ways to earn money. These include dual licensing, support subscriptions, a knowledgebase, consulting, an Enterprise/Community split, trying to make parts of the server closed-source, making tools in a split community/premium version, building functionality externally in closed-source software where they can charge for it, and most recently creating three tiers of functionality for the MySQL 5.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 11, 2008</span>
        With all the furor over MySQL 5.1 GA, its release schedule, its quality, etc etc I think a fundamental claim is being left un-examined. Lots of people are saying that if you leave out the new features in 5.1 and look only at the features that existed in 5.0, it&rsquo;s better quality.
The implication is that the process of building 5.1 looked like this: rip out nasty code and fix it all up, so there&rsquo;s a brand new architecture free of code debt.

        Sometimes there are funny communication styles between people who are geographically distributed and working together all the time. Recently one of our team members echoed back to me some answers I gave over a chat session:
 Q: Is it OK for me to buy quad-core servers?
A: The old man walks slow but carries much, whilst the young boy runs without a care.
 Okay, okay maybe I wasn&rsquo;t very clear in my message, and maybe it was just a little bit Confucian.

        It has all played itself out according to Microsoft&rsquo;s wishes. They have railroaded through a so-called standard for document representation, gotten it rubber-stamped by so-called standards bodies, and fought their way past all the objections of sensible people and companies. In the process, lots of developing nations have been steamrolled, too. Shame, shame, shame.

        MySQL's version numbering is getting harder and harder to understand. In fact, it's getting surreal.
Let me state up front that there's probably a lot I don't know here. But if I don't know, how on earth can the general public figure it out?
Before we begin, let's define terms: GA is completely done, ready for use. RC is a release candidate: don't change anything, just fix bugs because we're charging towards a release here.

        Joel Spolsky writes about 12 steps to better code, and elsewhere about how candidates should write code in interviews.
The reverse conditions are true, too. If you&rsquo;re a candidate, you should evaluate the employer against the 12 steps, and you should also see code samples. How else will you know what you&rsquo;re getting into? You really have the right to do this, and you should exercise the right. If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll get stuck in a crap job maintaining crap code.
