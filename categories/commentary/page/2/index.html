        <span class="post-date">Tue, Mar 5, 2013</span>
        I&rsquo;ve been increasingly questioning the current model of university education in the US. Not only the value for the money, but just the entire notion that it&rsquo;s a good way to learn. I got my Bachelor&rsquo;s in Computer Science from UVA, which has been going through utter facepalm-worthy madness recently. It may be biasing my point of view.
A friend recently sent me this:

        I was discussing how to avoid surprising users and someone pointed out that what seems intuitive and rational to one person is often complete insanity for others. The mental gap between a developer and a user can often be a chasm far too wide to cross. Of all the bug reports I&rsquo;ve filed against MySQL, here is my all-time favorite:

        A couple of months ago I bent the ear of a friend whose opinion I really respect. She&rsquo;s a totally sharp engineer who actively writes code for a living as well as managing large teams. She&rsquo;s held top-level technical roles at some large and extremely respectable companies. In short, her perspective and experience is very valuable.
One of my most important questions was what technologies she saw as established or emerging winners &ndash; good technologies to use as the foundation for a startup.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Nov 15, 2012</span>
        With the Big Data craze that&rsquo;s sweeping the world of technology right now, I often ask myself whether we&rsquo;re deficit-spending, so to speak, with our data consumption habits. I&rsquo;ve seen repeated examples of being unwilling to get rid of data, even though it&rsquo;s unused and nobody can think of a future use for it. At the same time, much Big Data processing I&rsquo;ve seen is brute-force and costly: hitting a not-very-valuable nut with a giant, expensive sledgehammer.

        Better performance is important in everything, not just MySQL. I don&rsquo;t want to wait for my text editor to open a file or perform syntax highlighting. I don&rsquo;t want to wait for my version control system to compute diffs or update my copy of the code with other peoples&rsquo; changes. I don&rsquo;t want to wait for my code to compile. I don&rsquo;t want to wait, period.
Two tools I have enjoyed recently are Git and the Go language.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, May 29, 2012</span>
        I took a course on engineering ethics as part of my degree in computer science, and decided that it was very important for me to formally ascribe to a recognized code of conduct. This is not just a principle, but also an important legal matter in today&rsquo;s litigious atmosphere. Court cases have literally been defended by engineers pointing to a code of ethics as their guidelines for actions and decisions.

        I got a really intriguing email today. As you might imagine, I get a lot of email offering to advertise, or trade links, or guest post, etc etc. But this is the most compelling one I&rsquo;ve ever gotten:
 I came across your blog /blog/2009/03/13/50-things-to-know-before-migrating-oracle-to-mysql/ a few weeks ago as while conducting research for a website that I contribute to. The website aims to look at the progressive areas of early childhood psychology.

        If you&rsquo;re in the DC area, there&rsquo;s an emergency meeting of the DC Tech Meetup to get involved in advocating against SOPA and PIPA legislation.
If you can&rsquo;t make it in person, you can use the EFF&rsquo;s online form to write your representatives about SOPA and PIPA.
Don&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s too late. The Internet is a vital part of our freedom. Well-intentioned legislators could damage that greatly while trying to solve problems they don&rsquo;t understand fully.

        I&rsquo;ve never objected to someone making money from MySQL. I&rsquo;ve only expressed disappointment that they weren&rsquo;t doing it effectively enough. As I have predicted many times, Oracle is good at this. Oracle is the number one reason I didn&rsquo;t start a new career in some other database a few years ago. Oracle is making MySQL more successful not only for Oracle, but also for the users, the community, and the competition.

        The single most important skill I learned in university while getting a degree in Computer Science was how to write better.
Everything important you do in your professional life is about communication. The ability to write clearly and concisely, with at least approximately correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation, is vital.
Despite what some people say to me on a regular basis, I am not &ldquo;a natural&rdquo; at this. I thought I was when I entered college.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Jul 4, 2011</span>
        It&rsquo;s notoriously hard to measure the usage of open-source software. Software that&rsquo;s open-source or free can be redistributed far and wide, so the original creators have no idea how many times it&rsquo;s installed, deployed, or distributed. As a proxy, we often use downloads, but that&rsquo;s woefully inadequate.
I&rsquo;ve recently begun trying to figure out how many job openings are mentioning various open-source projects. I think that this might be a better metric because it&rsquo;s driven by the end result (usage), rather than intermediate processes (downloads, etc).

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jun 28, 2011</span>
        tl;dr version: I like XFCE better than Gnome 3.
I wrote previously about trying out Gnome 3. I&rsquo;ve been using it for about a month now, and it&rsquo;s time for me to make a decision about whether to keep using it or revert to Gnome 2. I&rsquo;m actually on vacation, which ends soon. I need to do this before vacation ends, so I can be fully productive at work.
My ultimate impression of Gnome 3 is that it&rsquo;s very slick, and makes significant improvements in some ways, but it&rsquo;s not very usable for my purposes, and has too many self-contradictions.

        I see that a lot of people just don&rsquo;t get it when they start talking about high availability, redundancy, failover, etc. This is probably not going to change, but maybe I can try anyway.
Let&rsquo;s think about how you can survive a massive Amazon AWS failure. You build your application to automatically move services to another part of the infrastructure that&rsquo;s still up. Great! Now assume that everyone else is smart, too.

        I think we&rsquo;re beginning to see cloud computing mature a little bit. There is a long ways to go, but I am detecting more sober thinking on a wider scale. The events of last week, where many people were affected by Amazon&rsquo;s outages, are helping clues sink in a little bit.
There are a lot of risks that don&rsquo;t go away when you use cloud platforms. There are a lot of new risks that you&rsquo;ll encounter.

        These days it seems that people would rather generate a shortlink than use a real link, even when it&rsquo;s not much shorter. It&rsquo;s hip, after all. (Peter actually caught me doing this. It was for a link that used to be long but was shortened recently so a shortlink isn&rsquo;t needed anymore. I did it to continue a habit, not for hipness.)
I&rsquo;ve begun to see an increasing number of drawbacks to short link services.

        People keep asking me &ldquo;what is going to happen to MySQL now that Oracle has screwed MySQL?&rdquo; I bluntly disagree that any such thing has happened. This blog post is just my personal view and does not reflect my employer&rsquo;s opinion, but Oracle might have saved MySQL from what I can see. There is no evidence that supports the hysterical doomsday theories. (Witness MySQL 5.5, probably the best MySQL release in history.

        I see that &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; has become the new buzzword with a spike of hype around it. Everyone&rsquo;s jumping on it. Companies are eager to promote their products as &ldquo;Big Data,&rdquo; just as they were eager to be associated with Web 2.0, Service-Oriented Architectures, and all the rest. Predictably, there&rsquo;s basically zero agreement on what it means.
I&rsquo;ve seen &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; mentioned in the context of 1TB, which I think is rather moderate sized.

        There have been a few great blog posts recently from MySQL bloggers about Postgres, and vice versa, with good comments and follow-on from the real experts in both systems. I think this is wonderful. Learning how other databases solve hard problems is highly educational, especially because ACID databases face some of the hardest problems in computing. Making MySQL better is good for PostgreSQL. The reverse is just as true. And we should also be learning from SQLite, and CouchDB, and others who have overcome tough technical hurdles, built successful companies, created thriving and enthusiastic communities, or whatever their success has been.

        This is the follow-up to my post on how I keep track of tasks. It&rsquo;s important for me to have a good system for keeping notes and other files organized. The problem usually turns out to be that I want them organized several different ways simultaneously: by date, by project, by person, by subject. Alas, if I keep them in files on a hard drive, I can only choose one such organizing strategy, because filesystems are a single hierarchy.

        There&rsquo;s lots of buzz lately about the so-called &ldquo;open-core&rdquo; business model of Marten Mickos&rsquo;s new employer. But this is nothing new. Depending on how you define it, InnoDB is &ldquo;open-core,&rdquo; and has been for a long time. The InnoDB Hot Backup (ibbackup) tool was always closed-source. Did anyone ever cry foul and claim that this made InnoDB itself not open-source, or accuse Innobase / Oracle of masquerading as open-source? I don&rsquo;t recall that happening, although sometimes people got suspicious about the interplay between the backup tool and the storage engine.
