        Some of the utilities we were adding to Maatkit really did not belong there. Yes, this included some of the functionality in the now-retired mk-audit tool. We really learned a lesson about what it&rsquo;s possible to support, design, spec, code, and test in a single tool.
I&rsquo;ve moved those tools to a new project, Aspersa. Some folks are revolting and calling it Asparagus, because apparently that&rsquo;s easier to say. Aspersa is the name of the common garden snail, which turns out to be a fascinating creature.

        I&rsquo;ve released version 1.1.6 of the Better Cacti Templates project. This release includes a bunch of bug fixes (but not all of them!) and two new sets of graphs. One set is for disk I/O on GNU/Linux, and the other is a new set of templates for OpenVZ. I&rsquo;m looking for feedback on both of those. This release also has a bunch of code-level features: much better test coverage (hooray!), and a refactored ss_get_by_ssh.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 9, 2010</span>
        <p>The <code>iostat</code> tool is one of the most important for measuring disk performance, which of course is very relevant for database administrators, whether your chosen database is Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, or anything else that runs on GNU/Linux. Have you ever wondered where statistics like await (average wait for the request to complete) come from? If you look at the disk statistics the <a href="http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/iostats.txt">Linux kernel makes available through files such as /proc/diskstats</a>, you won&rsquo;t see await there. How does iostat compute await? For that matter, how does it compute the average queue size, service time, and utilization? This blog post will show you how that&rsquo;s computed.</p>

        I&rsquo;ve released version 1.1.5 of my improved Cacti templates for MySQL and other components of a LAMP application. This is a pure bug-fix release. One of the bug fixes prevents spikes in graphs, but requires you to rebuild your RRD files. There are upgrade instructions on the project wiki for this and all releases. Use the project issue tracker to view and report issues, and use the project mailing list to discuss the templates and scripts.

        I&rsquo;ve released version 1.1.4 of my improved Cacti templates. Unlike the prior release, which was solely bug fixes, this one includes new graphs in the MySQL template. Some of the graphs are of data that&rsquo;s exposed in standard MySQL versions, but some of it is available only in Percona&rsquo;s high-performance builds of the MySQL database server. If you don&rsquo;t have a Percona build, those graphs will just contain nothing, but there is no detrimental effect.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Oct 21, 2009</span>
        Maatkit&rsquo;s mk-loadavg tool is a helpful way to gather information about infrequent conditions on your database server (or any other server, really). We wrote it at Percona to help with those repeated cases of things like &ldquo;every two weeks, my database stops processing queries for 30 seconds, but it&rsquo;s not locked up and during this time there is nothing happening.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s pretty much impossible to catch in action, and these conditions can take months to resolve without the aid of good tools.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Aug 23, 2009</span>
        Newer Linux kernels have per-process I/O accounting and you can use the iotop tool to find out what&rsquo;s performing I/O, but in many cases I&rsquo;m trying to find the source of an I/O problem in an older kernel. I found sort of a hack-ish way to do that today, while trying to figure out why a system was basically unresponsive.
I found a post on Stack Overflow that showed a way you can get per process I/O statistics from the kernel even in older kernels.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, May 4, 2009</span>
        Maatkit version 3519 is ready for download. There are a lot of changes in this release, many of which are incompatible with previous releases. There are also a lot of important new features. Read on for the details.
First, thanks to everyone who contributed to this month&rsquo;s release. A lot of people have jumped into Maatkit and started committing code. I attribute this to deliberately forcing a more open policy with decisions being made on the mailing list, rather than the former policy of &ldquo;Percona pays for development, so they have more say than you do&rdquo; &ndash; a snobby and ill-advised way to treat an open-source project.

        Domas Mituzas mentioned this recently. It&rsquo;s so cool I just have to write about it. Here&rsquo;s an easy command to fork off a bunch of jobs in parallel: xargs.
seq 10 20 | xargs -n 1 -P 5 sleep This will send a sequence of numbers to xargs, which will divide it into chunks of one argument at a time and fork off 5 parallel processes to execute each. You can see it in action:

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Oct 16, 2008</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve been working with a client recently who has <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/">SELinux</a> on his servers.  It has been quite a struggle sometimes.</p>

<p>My colleages tell me that SELinux has a pretty noticeable performance impact.  I am not sure if we have benchmarks to support this; at any rate, the client said it&rsquo;s OK, we&rsquo;ll take the performance hit.</p>

<p>There have been a few problems (Nagios can&rsquo;t run because it can&rsquo;t write to its own pid file, etc etc).  Last night there was something new: &ldquo;too many connections&rdquo; when trying to connect to MySQL.  As a result the site was down, and it wasn&rsquo;t possible to log in to MySQL and see why. But the oddest thing happened: mysqld would not shut down.  It was sitting basically idle, doing absolutely nothing, and wouldn&rsquo;t stop. There was nothing in any log files to show what might be going on.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Sep 19, 2008</span>
        <p>There&rsquo;s a new release with a lot of goodies &ndash; speed, efficiency, user-friendliness, and new features. In particular some of <a href="http://www.percona.com/">Percona&rsquo;s</a> clients have sponsored features for things they need such as the ability to more frequently verify that replicas are in sync with their masters. If you need features, please ask Percona about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://hackmysql.com/">Daniel Nichter</a> has written most of the code for this release. Having a dedicated developer is really moving the project forward. Thanks Daniel!</p>

<p>If you check the issues list on the project&rsquo;s website you&rsquo;ll see we have some ambitious plans for the project, mostly driven by real-world needs from Percona&rsquo;s clients, many of whom run very large data centers and such. It makes me really happy that Maatkit is solving serious problems for which no other solution exists.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the changelog:</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Aug 21, 2008</span>
        <p>Rob Young has posted a few blog entries lately on the MySQL Enterprise monitoring software. His latest post claims that agent-based monitoring is equivalent to extensibility (<a href="http://theopenproductmanager.blogspot.com/2008/08/mysql-enterprise-monitor-agent.html">MySQL Enterprise Monitor: Agent = Extensibility</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: <a href="https://vividcortex.com/">VividCortex</a> is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what
your servers are doing in production. VividCortex offers <a href="https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/mysql/">MySQL performance
monitoring</a> and <a href="https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/postgres/">PostgreSQL
performance management</a> among many
other features.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is conflating two completely distinct properties of a monitoring solution. <a href="http://www.cacti.net/">Cacti</a> is extremely extensible, with a plugin-based architecture and templates and all kinds of other goodies; yet it is not agent-based (actually it lets you choose &ndash; now that&rsquo;s extensibility). <a href="http://code.google.com/p/innotop/">innotop</a> is not agent-based, and it&rsquo;s extremely extensible too. Basically everything inside innotop is a lookup table of anonymous subroutines and data structures that you can tweak pretty much infinitely with plugins and configuration files that get merged into the running code dynamically. Extensibility is completely orthogonal to whether the architecture is agent-based. What about WordPress? It&rsquo;s ridiculously extensible and it has nothing to do with agents.</p>

<p>So now that we&rsquo;ve clarified that, what can we say about agent-based or agentless architectures? Which is better?</p>
