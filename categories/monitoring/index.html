        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 7, 2015</span>
        <p>I was talking with someone the other day about a visualization I remembered
seeing some years ago, that could help set a reasonable value for a threshold on
a metric. As I&rsquo;ve
<a href="https://www.vividcortex.com/blog/2013/04/10/2-reasons-why-threshold-based-monitoring-is-hopelessly-broken/">written</a>,
thresholds are basically a broken way to monitor systems, but if you&rsquo;re going to
use them, I think there are simple things you can do to avoid making threshold
values <em>completely</em> arbitrary.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find the place I&rsquo;d seen the visualization (if you know prior art for
the below, please comment!) so I decided to just blog about it. Suppose you
start off with a time series:</p>

In 2002, US Secretary of State Donald Rumsfeld told a reporter that not only don’t we know everything important, but sometimes we don’t even know what knowledge we lack:
 There are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns – the ones we don’t know we don’t know.

        If you follow what Percona is up to, you might have noticed that I&rsquo;ve created a set of high-quality monitoring and graphing plugins for MySQL and related systems. Currently they support Nagios and Cacti. I&rsquo;ll give a free webinar on March 28th discussing these, and more broadly, discussing how to monitor MySQL successfully to avoid common problems like spammy alerts about nonexistent problems.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, May 25, 2010</span>
        The traditional way to build Cacti templates is through the Cacti web interface. This is an enormous amount of work, and the result is generally not very consistent or good quality. The process is too error-prone. You can export the templates as XML, but they tend to have problems such as version incompatibilities with other Cacti installations, and it&rsquo;s hard to adapt them for user preferences such as different graph image sizes and polling intervals.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 9, 2010</span>
        <p>The <code>iostat</code> tool is one of the most important for measuring disk performance, which of course is very relevant for database administrators, whether your chosen database is Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, or anything else that runs on GNU/Linux. Have you ever wondered where statistics like await (average wait for the request to complete) come from? If you look at the disk statistics the <a href="http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/iostats.txt">Linux kernel makes available through files such as /proc/diskstats</a>, you won&rsquo;t see await there. How does iostat compute await? For that matter, how does it compute the average queue size, service time, and utilization? This blog post will show you how that&rsquo;s computed.</p>

One of the bug fixes prevents spikes in graphs, but requires you to rebuild your RRD files. There are upgrade instructions on the project wiki for this and all releases.

        I&rsquo;ve released version 1.1.4 of my improved Cacti templates. Unlike the prior release, which was solely bug fixes, this one includes new graphs in the MySQL template. Some of the graphs are of data that&rsquo;s exposed in standard MySQL versions, but some of it is available only in Percona&rsquo;s high-performance builds of the MySQL database server. If you don&rsquo;t have a Percona build, those graphs will just contain nothing, but there is no detrimental effect.

To upgrade from the previous release, upgrade ss_get_mysql_stats.php. Don&rsquo;t forget to save and restore your configuration options, if any. (Note that there is a feature to help with this: you can keep configuration options in ss_get_mysql_stats.php.cnf to avoid making them in ss_get_mysql_stats.php.)

        A client recently asked me to fix some Cacti graphs that had broken after upgrading the Cacti templates I wrote for MySQL. The symptoms were weird; I&rsquo;m not sure I understand fully what happened, but some of the graphs were OK and some had only part of the data they were supposed to. Some graphs would have one data element as usual, and others would be nan (not a number).

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Apr 25, 2009</span>
        Cacti is a great tool for collecting information about systems and graphing it. However, it likes to use SNMP, and SNMP is often not desirable. Instead, I often see the need for a method that is:
 Secure. Use trusted, well-known, encrypted communication. Do not open up new ports. Zero install on the monitored system. As little installation or modification on the monitoring system as possible.  Over the last several years, I&rsquo;ve slowly created more and more software to create Cacti graphs via standard POSIX command-line utilities over SSH with key-pair authentication.

        <p>I&rsquo;ve released version 1.1.1 of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/">MySQL Cacti templates</a> I develop. The new templates work around more Cacti limitations, including the limitation on the length of the data returned from the poller script. There&rsquo;s also a new graph and many other niceties since the last release.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://vividcortex.com/">VividCortex</a> is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what
your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers <a href="https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/mysql/">MySQL performance
monitoring</a> and <a href="https://vividcortex.com/monitoring/postgres/">PostgreSQL
performance management</a> among many
other features.</p>
