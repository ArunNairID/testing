        <p>I&rsquo;ve created a set of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/">Cacti templates for graphing stats about MySQL</a>. While these were based on several other people&rsquo;s work, there are many improvements. One of them in particular I want to bring up, and I&rsquo;ll go so far as to say it ought to be a &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; for graphing. That is, don&rsquo;t mix units on a graph.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Aug 21, 2008</span>
        <p>Rob Young has posted a few blog entries lately on the MySQL Enterprise monitoring software. His latest post claims that agent-based monitoring is equivalent to extensibility (<a href="http://theopenproductmanager.blogspot.com/2008/08/mysql-enterprise-monitor-agent.html">MySQL Enterprise Monitor: Agent = Extensibility</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: <a href="https://vividcortex.com/">VividCortex</a> is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what

<p>I think this is conflating two completely distinct properties of a monitoring solution. <a href="http://www.cacti.net/">Cacti</a> is extremely extensible, with a plugin-based architecture and templates and all kinds of other goodies; yet it is not agent-based (actually it lets you choose &ndash; now that&rsquo;s extensibility). <a href="http://code.google.com/p/innotop/">innotop</a> is not agent-based, and it&rsquo;s extremely extensible too. Basically everything inside innotop is a lookup table of anonymous subroutines and data structures that you can tweak pretty much infinitely with plugins and configuration files that get merged into the running code dynamically. Extensibility is completely orthogonal to whether the architecture is agent-based. What about WordPress? It&rsquo;s ridiculously extensible and it has nothing to do with agents.</p>

<p>So now that we&rsquo;ve clarified that, what can we say about agent-based or agentless architectures? Which is better?</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Apr 27, 2008</span>
        As promised, I&rsquo;ve created some improved software for monitoring MySQL via Cacti. I began using the de facto MySQL Cacti templates a while ago, but found some things I needed to improve about them. As time passed, I rewrote everything from scratch. The resulting templates are much improved.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Mar 22, 2008</span>
        I have an issue I hope someone can help me with. I am generating RRDtool graphs (for Cacti monitoring templates for MySQL, which I'll release soon) that have up to 11 different metrics on them. With that many lines or areas on a graph, it becomes very hard to pick colors that are easy to see and easy to distinguish from each other. What's a good way to choose such colors?

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Nov 9, 2007</span>
        The 1.5.2 release of innotop contained two bugs, one very minor. The other was a crash because of the new functionality that aggregates results across many connections. I fixed them and released version 1.6.0, which I consider stable and ready for everyone to use. (My version naming convention for innotop is that even-numbered minor versions are for production use; odd-numbered, such as 1.5.2, are the development branch. That&rsquo;s why I release them under the innotop-devel package).

        This release is part of the unstable 1.5 branch. Its features will ultimately go into the stable 1.6 branch. You can download it from the innotop-devel package.

 The major change is I&rsquo;ve ripped out the W (Lock Waits) mode and enabled innotop to discover not only what a transaction is waiting for, but what it holds too.

        MySQL and InnoDB expose lots of information about their internals, but it&rsquo;s hard to gather it all into one place and make sense of it. I&rsquo;ve written a tool to do that, and you are free to download and use it. This article introduces innotop, a powerful text-mode MySQL and InnoDB monitoring tool.
