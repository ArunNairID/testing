          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling more people about the benefits I&amp;rsquo;ve received from
meditation. Meditation has greatly influenced the way I think, behave, and
relate to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/03/ripples.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ripples&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t take up meditation for many years was that everyone had a
different definition of meditation. It seemed that in an effort to let people
discover something that worked for them without being overly prescriptive, all
the sources I turned to ended up saying nothing useful about meditation.
Apparently it could be literally anything or nothing. Some said it was thinking
about something, focusing on a mantra or an image; others said it was enjoying
the laughter of children; others a feeling of serenity and calm&amp;mdash;all completely
unhelpful to me. Everyone was talking about it, and the only thing I could
conclude was that none of them were actually doing it. The jargon around it, and
the glib catchphrases, turned me off even more. People seemed to rely on
meaningless phrases  as placeholders for real substance (&amp;ldquo;shine the heart
forward as you connect your breath to your intention and invite your om shanti
to blossom into full expression&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still other people seemed to have urban myth misconceptions, and warned me for
example that I might never &amp;ldquo;come back,&amp;rdquo; telling me about people they knew who&amp;rsquo;d
apparently turned into vegetables or become comatose. I suspect that either
these stories were false or had more to do with other activities, such as heavy
drug use. The idea that someone could short out their brain circuits does not
seem realistic to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation may have many outcomes, such as serenity and clarity, but the goal is
quite simple: to train yourself to observe your own mind and see
reality as it is. By doing this, you realize that you are not your thoughts. You
learn that you are not your &amp;ldquo;self,&amp;rdquo; which in fact is a false identity created by
the thinking part of the mind. You learn that you can &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; without &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;,
that the mind&amp;rsquo;s job is to think, but that mistakenly identifying this activity
as &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; is to miss that the mind and its thinking are ripples on the surface
of a deep, still, underlying existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &amp;ldquo;I think, therefore I am&amp;rdquo; mistake is like walking into a room with a
radio blaring and mistakenly believing that the radio is the room. If
you turn off the radio, the room still exists. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard some
sentences to the effect of &amp;ldquo;what is the sound of one hand clapping&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;if you
sit in silence, what you hear is the sound of the universe&amp;rdquo; and the like.
They&amp;rsquo;re trying to explain the undescribable, that which can only be explained by
pointing to what it&amp;rsquo;s not: the room is essentially silent, with radio noise
in it. Take away the noise and the silence is still there. Turn the radio
on again and the silence is still there, coexisting with the noise. Others
explain it by saying that the pool is still at the bottom even if there are
ripples on top, or that the sky is always blue above the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation helps you separate your existence from your thinking, which helps you
learn to sense and experience the silence, the blue sky, the stillness at the
bottom of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By training yourself to observe your mind, you become conscious of what it does.
Much of it is useful, but much isn&amp;rsquo;t. And if you are unconscious of these
thoughts, then your mind is in control of you, and not the other way around.
Developing the ability to witness your mind, and know it as something separate,
allows you to be unattached to the mind&amp;rsquo;s cravings, fears, doubts, conditioned
reactions, aversions, delusions, and other misery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s taken me half a dozen years to reach the point I have now. There were many
detours and many false prophets; many people teaching meditation without knowing
it themselves. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve found my way past those, everything is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll give two concrete examples of how meditation has changed me. Some months
ago I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/11/10/what-its-like/&#34;&gt;the agonizing pain and stress of being a
founder&lt;/a&gt;. The company was doing great,
investors were doubling down, customers were flocking to us, the team was
clicking into high gear, I had absolutely nothing to worry about, and yet I was
at the end of my rope. In fact, the better things got, the more exciting and
promising the future looked, the more stressed I was. My mind was getting the
bit between its teeth and running away, with me kicking and screaming along for
the ride. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation helped me realize that my problem was attaching my attention to
thoughts about the future. All of this good news about the company was tempting
me to think about what might happen, what looked likely to happen, what could
be. You who are practiced in meditation already know what I&amp;rsquo;m going to say. I
was taking my mind off the &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; and projecting it into a nonexistent future,
where good things might come to pass&amp;mdash;but then again they might not. For every
potentially good thing about which I could get excited, there was an equal and
opposite fear that it might not happen. In other words, the future is a mental
construct where the mind can project fear, doubt, and worry. It is a fabrication
that the mind creates to facilitate attaching itself and its sense of self-worth
to things that don&amp;rsquo;t even exist, so that it can freak out because they might
never exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example is related to this projection into the future.  The pain and
stress were doubly acute for me because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t used to thinking about the
future. Most of my life, just the opposite was true, and I avoided thoughts of
the future. I spent years in therapy trying to understand and recover from some
traumatic experiences I&amp;rsquo;d had. Every session my therapist would say, &amp;ldquo;Think back
to that time. Tell me about it.&amp;rdquo; The therapist was trying, in a Freudian way, to
help me do the same things as meditation does&amp;mdash;see my reactions to my thoughts
and memories, and disidentify from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation has helped me more in the space of a few months than therapy helped
in years. If I&amp;rsquo;d learned to meditate, I am pretty sure that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
have needed therapy. And I always felt vaguely sure, in a way I couldn&amp;rsquo;t
explain, that there had to be a more effective way of healing than repeatedly
talking about the horrible things that I&amp;rsquo;d experienced. Now I know what I was
groping for: a more direct and less abstract way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swinging from the past into the future, and experiencing it with a brutal shock,
then becoming aware that this was what was happening to me, taught me that life
must be lived&amp;mdash;indeed, &lt;em&gt;can only&lt;/em&gt; be lived&amp;mdash;in the present moment. The past no
longer exists. If I recall it, I&amp;rsquo;m recreating a memory of the past, and I&amp;rsquo;m
doing it in the now. If I think forward to the future, which likewise does not
exist, I&amp;rsquo;m doing the same thing and I&amp;rsquo;m doing it in the now. The past existed
once, but when it did, it was the now. The future, when it comes to be, will
come to be in the now. Now is the only moment that exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there is no multi-tasking. Attention given to one thing is taken from
another. Attention given to a memory is taken from the now that exists. In other
words, remembering the past or waiting for the future is actually opting not to
live at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meditate is to be in the now, to notice when thoughts arise, and to release
them rather than engaging them. Indulge me as I deploy another bad analogy: when
you&amp;rsquo;re caught up in thoughts, it&amp;rsquo;s as if you&amp;rsquo;re reading the mail; the
independent, outside observer is switched off and attention resides in the
thoughts themselves. When you&amp;rsquo;re observing the thoughts and releasing them, it&amp;rsquo;s
as if you&amp;rsquo;re simply handling or sorting the mail, shuffling it onwards without
opening the envelopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meditate is to see clearly the mind&amp;rsquo;s activity, the
thoughts, as separate.  It relies for its working on the impossibility of
multi-tasking. You can&amp;rsquo;t stop a thought; the harder you try, the more you&amp;rsquo;re
actually thinking about it. Instead, &lt;em&gt;experiencing&lt;/em&gt; the object of focus (usually
the breath) is a way of taking the focus from the thought and returning it to
the breath. In time, with practice, you realize that there is a &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; that
witnesses either the thought or the breath, and that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; is what you
might call Being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cannot be achieved by willing it; in fact, will is an exercise of the mind
and only binds you more tightly. You achieve it by relinquishing, releasing,
stepping back, surrendering, accepting, letting go of the will and experiencing
what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation is also &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what some people commonly say it is. It isn&amp;rsquo;t
relaxation or calm or inner peace (those are potential outcomes). It isn&amp;rsquo;t
thought control, the ability to stop thoughts. It isn&amp;rsquo;t a way to exercise the
mind to achieve greater intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;rsquo;t be explained (and I&amp;rsquo;m not doing it justice), it must be experienced. It
takes time. It takes practice.  It is a training exercise. The goal is to carry
present-moment awareness into every moment, to experience the present rather
than to be a couch potato in the room with the radio, absorbed in the
chatter, missing life as it exists in the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meditate is to train yourself to actually &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt;, to engage, to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this post reflects my current understanding. Those who are more
advanced than I will surely recognize my errors. To those who are less far along
the path, I hope it is helpful, and leads no one astray.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>My Daily Inspiration Experiment</title>

          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2016/01/09/daily-inspiration-experiment/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;About 18 months ago I began an experiment on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/01/snowflake.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;snowflake&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years I have maintained a variety of daily practices I have found helpful to become a better me and manage &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/11/10/what-its-like/&#34;&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;. These include meditation, prayer, writing, drawing, music, reading a variety of literature including sacred texts, poetry, and self-help (for lack of a better word), and above all else, reflection. I don&amp;rsquo;t always do all of these things every day, and sometimes I move in and out of phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reflection I seek to understand, in a way that is meaningful to me, whatever external thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen from others. By doing this I allow all the various aspects of myself to react to these thoughts, and have a sort of internal discussion to enrich and absorb the meaning. My goal is to own the thought for myself, to express it in my own words and feelings. If I can crystallize the thought in the way that&amp;rsquo;s most consequential to me in that moment, I can integrate it into my consciousness and carry it with me through the day and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d become dissatisfied with social media, and I decided that instead of keeping these thoughts to myself, I&amp;rsquo;d share them. My goals were to offset the negativity I saw, balancing it with something more positive; to offer the thoughts for others to do with as they wished; and to let others participate in my own journey, reflecting back to me things I perhaps didn&amp;rsquo;t consider about those thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began using Buffer to share these thoughts at scheduled times on the various social media accounts I use. Although I am sure they look suspiciously like copy-paste from a daily inspirational website, they are more or less original. In any case, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a verse from sacred poetry or a lyric from a pop singer, it&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve made my own in a sort of quiet worship. It&amp;rsquo;s not cheap regurgitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one time I tried working with a remote &amp;ldquo;virtual&amp;rdquo; personal assistant. They suggested that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t spending my time wisely on this, and they offered to take over for me and find and post inspirational messages on my behalf. Of course that would have missed the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/01/dt130115.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Dilbert&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing such deeply personal reflections has risks and rewards, and my calculus was that the rewards would outweigh the risks. What kinds of risks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accidental coincidences with world events. (I had to hastily unschedule one queued message when there was a tragic event it seemed to respond to.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misreadings. Or, sometimes, correct readings of something I stated badly and didn&amp;rsquo;t mean the way I wrote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any type of religious message, intentional or not, that might offend someone with different views.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also knew that I&amp;rsquo;d actually end up exposing parts of myself that others would find unlovable or needing correction. I didn&amp;rsquo;t view this as a risk, but as a reward. Better to find out sooner, and learn and grow, than persist in bigotry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I knew I&amp;rsquo;d occasionally trigger some of the general hatefulness that flourishes on the internet, and tempt the trolls into targeting me. Fortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m a white male American, so I have the privilege of basically feeling immune to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned is fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the face of it, people generally find those inspirational posts much less interesting than others. My Twitter statistics, for example, show way less engagement and sharing of those tweets. This could reflect the fact that they look like so much other &amp;ldquo;inspirational&amp;rdquo; stuff on social media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten all kinds of responses. People have indeed told me I&amp;rsquo;m in need of improvement, but others have told me they find it deeply meaningful and helpful. Some have thanked me for helping them find hope and comfort in difficult times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some thoughts have had a variety of meanings to different people. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example, where one person had an &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mcfunley/status/668491505590382593&#34;&gt;interesting and completely valid alternative reading&lt;/a&gt; of my inspirational quote. (The ensuing conversation brought up the meaning I&amp;rsquo;d intended.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People read the thoughts not as the thoughts are, but as &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are. For example, devotees of different faiths sometimes respond in ways that express a sense of identifying me as a member of their faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pleased with the results of sharing these thoughts widely and opening them up to other peoples&amp;rsquo; reactions. I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve invited a large group of people to help me grow, and at the same time I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to them, which is a good thing. When something&amp;rsquo;s caused offense it&amp;rsquo;s often been the source of additional learning and growth for me. And, in studying the reactions to what I share, I find an additional opportunity to reflect back to myself a sense of belonging and similarity: if I were not myself, I&amp;rsquo;d likely react to me just as many others do. We are all so different yet so fundamentally equal in our shared humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These inspirational messages are also related to a set of &amp;ldquo;thought leadership&amp;rdquo; blog posts and other content I&amp;rsquo;ve written or contributed to in the last year. When time permits I&amp;rsquo;ll try to write about what that&amp;rsquo;s taught me, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to read my daily self-inspiration, I invite you to follow me on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/xaprb&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/baron.schwartz&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://linkedin.com/in/xaprb&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to express my deep gratitude to the hundreds of people who&amp;rsquo;ve inspired me, too, many of you unknowingly.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Feelings and Behaviors</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2016/01/03/feelings-and-behaviors/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 03 Jan 2016 15:56:52 -0500</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2016/01/03/feelings-and-behaviors/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a new year and I drew a diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/01/feelings-and-behaviors.png&#34; alt=&#34;Feelings and Behaviors&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This diagram shows the spectra of what I can pay attention to and focus upon.
Along one axis, I can range between focusing on my feelings, or focusing on
other peoples&amp;rsquo; feelings. On the other, I can observe and learn from my actions
and their consequences, or I can notice what others do and what results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This diagram probably means something different to everyone
who reads it, but here&amp;rsquo;s what it means to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The healthiest people I know tend to care about &lt;strong&gt;what they do and how other
people feel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most troubled people I&amp;rsquo;ve known have focused on &lt;strong&gt;how they feel and what
other people do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other two quadrants are less pathological; more about them later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drew circles in the top-right and bottom-left because I believe there are
positions of dynamic equilibrium in these locations.  People who live top-right
don&amp;rsquo;t fix their attention unwaveringly on other/self; rather, they move fluidly
between external and internal observation and reasoning. This virtuous cycle is
a dynamic dance of loving, generous relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to live bottom-left, which is a vicious cycle, not a virtuous one. I saw
myself as a helpless victim, against whom the universe and world constantly
plotted.  I spent my time and energy noticing how I felt, ignoring my behaviors,
and blaming my feelings on what other people had &amp;ldquo;done to&amp;rdquo; me.  I modulated
these behaviors only enough to poke my head out of my hole and confirm my
suspicions that I was just a casualty of &amp;ldquo;the system&amp;rdquo; and the deck was all
stacked against me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other two quadrants don&amp;rsquo;t tend to be positions of equilibrium long-term.
Whether a person ends up top-right or bottom-left is a product of many different
possible circumstances, in my experience (N=1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more regions on this map than I&amp;rsquo;ve shown. For example, there are
people who live top-left in healthy ways. And most people aren&amp;rsquo;t possible to
represent as a point on the map. They occupy some area, usually rather fluidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m continually inspired by the people around me who live more in the top right
quadrant.  To the extent that I move upwards and rightwards this New Year, I
know I will be the better for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experience fewer moments of that old bottom-left behavior every New Year than
I did the year before. This is usually because of the choices I make&amp;ndash;much less
so than random events or other peoples&amp;rsquo; actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, I can choose where I direct my attention. This is tangible evidence
of what I really value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>Personality Assessments</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/10/11/personality-assessments/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 11 Oct 2015 11:26:16 -0400</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/10/11/personality-assessments/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of years I have increasingly studied and used personality tests for personal and professional uses, both for myself and for others. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a variety of benefits, but these assessments are not without drawbacks, and not all assessments are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/10/different.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;different&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personality assessments, at their finest, are statistical tools created and validated by teams of psychologists and mathematicians. At their worst, they are snake oil, invented and promoted by people with no real expertise, and claimed to achieve results that stretch credibility, sometimes even though they&amp;rsquo;ve been repeatedly shown not to work. There are many shades of gray in between: tests that work okay but are difficult to interpret, tests that show results that aren&amp;rsquo;t really actionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-assessments-good-for&#34;&gt;What Are Assessments Good For?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found that the better-designed assessments can be helpful for understanding a variety of aspects of myself and others. I always use myself as the first test subject. Part of my personality (which the best tests confirm!) is a desire to improve myself through observation and understanding, so I can see my strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the insights to help me understand how I can do things such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand where and when I&amp;rsquo;m likely to behave well or badly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predict how a person will respond to interactions and adjust my approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate effectively, using a person&amp;rsquo;s natural style instead of my own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Match a person&amp;rsquo;s strengths to a situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask better questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also use assessments, individually and with teams, to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help people understand themselves and their desired career paths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform pairwise comparisons between people and help coach them through the results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help groups understand how they&amp;rsquo;re similar or different (e.g. sales vs marketing vs engineering) and how to accommodate those differences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine what behaviors, motivations, and skills are required for a role, and in which areas a candidate is a good match for that (job and gap reports).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-kinds-of-assessments-are-there&#34;&gt;What Kinds Of Assessments Are There?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, many assessments try to examine a person from a few viewpoints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behaviors. These are externally observable tendencies. Generally they focus on a person&amp;rsquo;s preferred style of behavior, sometimes under a variety of situations such as stress. Behaviors often include the style of interaction with others as well as alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivators. These &amp;ldquo;values&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;driving forces&amp;rdquo; are internal preferences or situational factors that can help explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; a person behaves as they do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competencies. Tests of competency try to evaluate how well a person achieves specific types of tasks. Some tests try to evaluate &amp;ldquo;raw intelligence,&amp;rdquo; while others evaluate specific skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldview. These assessments rate a person&amp;rsquo;s attitudes and opinions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differences. Some assessments don&amp;rsquo;t try to judge what a person is good/bad or high/low at, but where they&amp;rsquo;re unusually different from other people; in other words, what makes them most uniquely themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found the behaviors and motivators far easier to understand than many of the other types of assessment results. I work with a professional management coach and I&amp;rsquo;m still studying and trying to learn to interpret some of the worldview assessments, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-assessments-valid-and-useful&#34;&gt;Are Assessments Valid And Useful?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of controversy over these assessments and their use in hiring or other professional situations. You can do a quick web search and immediately find more information than you need about the usefulness and validity of the assessments. For example, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cio.com/article/2861657/it-skills/are-personality-assessments-effective-hiring-tools.html&#34;&gt;CIO article&lt;/a&gt; concludes that personality assessments need to be used carefully but can be valuable, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/27/study-delivers-bleak-verdict-on-validity-of-psychology-experiment-results&#34;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; reports that psychology studies across the board don&amp;rsquo;t stand up well to rigorous science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After using them for a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the opinion that there really are good assessments, but the bad assessments give all of them a bad reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even the best assessments are imperfect. They&amp;rsquo;re based on statistically likely observations about large populations of people, and in my experience are often pretty accurate predictors, but not always. I&amp;rsquo;ve known a couple of people for whom specific results were quite wrong. Part of this comes down to how the person takes the assessment, and some kinds of personalities are actually harder to analyze than others. In other words, some people are naturally going to give answers that result in highly accurate outcomes, and some people will micro-analyze and defeat the test while they take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/10/mac-desktop.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mac&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to be careful when using the assessments in hiring, in particular. If you base a hiring decision on an assessment that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been subjected to adverse impact analysis, you could open yourself to claims of discrimination. I use the results to help me have a better conversation with the candidate, not to make a hire/reject decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the tests are just fluff. They&amp;rsquo;re like horoscopes, designed to sound meaningful for everyone. In fact, there have even been experiments on how much people believe personality assessments. (People believe the tests are accurate, even when the results are copy-pasted from an astrology book and everyone got the same answers. This is known as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect&#34;&gt;Barnum effect&lt;/a&gt;. You can take this &lt;a href=&#34;http://forer.netopti.net/&#34;&gt;bogus assessment&lt;/a&gt; yourself; after doing so, see how good you think the results are. This is a good trick to play on your friends.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, you can usually tell the smoke-and-mirrors tests by looking at how polished and slick the reports are. The better tests are usually more concerned with information than appearances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, my personal belief is that the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which is the most popular and well-known by far, is not very revealing. After you&amp;rsquo;ve studied other assessments for a while, the MBTI looks weak in comparison. I&amp;rsquo;ll let you study this on your own if you&amp;rsquo;re interested. For a little light reading you might be interested in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/03/29/for-holy-week-heres-how-you-can-match-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-to-a-patron-saint/&#34;&gt;how the MBTI types match up to patron saints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The better-quality assessments are based on well-known models of human psychology that were invented/discovered by researchers and have subsequently been commercialized, often by many companies. The Big Five and the DISC model are examples. There are many implementations of these models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When researching personality assessments online, I would caution you to take what you find with lots of skepticism. Predicting whether a person is a good fit for a job is an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; interesting outcome for companies, because hiring the best people and avoiding bad hires is often the difference between success and failure as a business. As a result, the companies that develop and administer the tests are making &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; good profits, and sometimes go to extremes to ensure that the information available online makes them look good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Wikipedia is not immune to this effect. Many articles about the assessments are full of weasel words and blatant advertising, and few people in the general public have the knowledge or motivation to properly moderate the articles, so you end up with claims like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The [redacted] has been considered the &amp;ldquo;gold standard&amp;rdquo; in personality testing&lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, my personal view is that any test that is offered &lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt; by a single company is suspect. I give more credence to models that were developed by researchers and then implemented by companies. I am also skeptical of companies that make sweeping claims such as &lt;em&gt;The XYZ assessments are ideal for a wide range of applications&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; In my opinion, no assessment is &amp;ldquo;ideal&amp;rdquo; for anything, much less a &amp;ldquo;wide range&amp;rdquo; of things. Unfortunately, even the tests that I believe are good use verbiage like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A word of caution: just because the questions you have to answer during the assessment seem vague or contradictory doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it is fluff. Many of the personality tests are designed to force you to compare and rank things that aren&amp;rsquo;t directly comparable. By doing this in a variety of dimensions, they are able to use factor analysis to get multi-dimensional results. This is a legitimate statistical technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;available-assessments&#34;&gt;Available Assessments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a stunning range of assessments available, ranging from amateur to academic to professional. For personal interest, they might all be fun to use, but for professional purposes I&amp;rsquo;d stick with ones that have invested in large-scale, longitudinal studies of effectiveness and adverse impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessments and companies that are widely used in business, from what I observed through discussions with various managers and recruiting specialists, are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ttisuccessinsights.com/&#34;&gt;TTI Success Insights&lt;/a&gt;, which is the company my coach and I use; it&amp;rsquo;s also what many companies such as the Rainmaker Group resell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.calipercorp.com/&#34;&gt;Caliper Hiring Assessments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.criteriacorp.com/solution/SalesAP.php&#34;&gt;Criteria Employment Tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://chally.com/solution-suite/predictive-assessments/&#34;&gt;Chally predictive assessments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.harrisonassessments.com/&#34;&gt;Harrison Assessment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.salesgenomix.com/&#34;&gt;SalesGenomix sales talent assessments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.innermetrix.com/products/assessments/&#34;&gt;InnerMetrix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the companies mentioned provide a range of assessments such as DISC and Big Five. Many of them also provide a free assessment, so if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in taking one for yourself, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay a lot of money for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some other resources online, each offering one or multiple tests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://personality-testing.info/&#34;&gt;personality-testing.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/&#34;&gt;The Big Five&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.keirsey.com/&#34;&gt;The Kiersey Sorter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.123test.com/&#34;&gt;A variety of free psych tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tonyrobbins.com/disc-profile/&#34;&gt;Tony Robbins&amp;rsquo;s test website&lt;/a&gt; provides InnerMetrix DISC and Values tests for free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some &lt;a href=&#34;http://ipip.ori.org/&#34;&gt;collaborations amongst scientists for free and open study&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/5/j5j/IPIP/&#34;&gt;free online version of the NEO PI-R test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, there&amp;rsquo;s more. Here are some other tests I&amp;rsquo;ve seen but haven&amp;rsquo;t examined much:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FIRO-B. I didn&amp;rsquo;t take a much deeper look because after examining one person&amp;rsquo;s report I concluded it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very useful. It&amp;rsquo;s also administered and sold by CPP, the company that promotes MBTI. I distrust it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Interpersonal Style Inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-disc-model&#34;&gt;The DISC Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most widely commercialized personality models is the DISC model. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the ones I use, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably one of the best to get started with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISC is an acronym for four dimensions of a person&amp;rsquo;s behavioral style&amp;mdash;things that are externally observable. Each dimension can rank from very low to very high. There&amp;rsquo;s a fair amount of interplay amongst the dimensions, and various combinations of them tend to indicate different things. In my own words, here&amp;rsquo;s a gross oversimplification:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The D stands for Dominance, sometimes called Directness. It relates to how you respond to challenges in your external environment: do you attack them forcefully and aggressively (high-D) or do you avoid or try to solve them indirectly? A person who&amp;rsquo;s high D gets right to the point and pushes themselves and others, and also in my experience tends to become very Defensive when challenged or coached.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The I stands for Influence, or Interactivity, and relates to how much you try to persuade others. A high-I person can win people to their point of view, typically by promoting its benefits. They are also similarly attracted to nice things themselves, and can sometimes be distracted by &amp;ldquo;shiny objects&amp;rdquo; or aesthetically pleasing things or experiences. A high-I person also tends to need lots of social interaction and may like being praised, especially in public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The S stands for Steadiness or Stability, and relates to preferred working style. A high-S person is patient and a focused single-tasker; a low-S person is a plate-spinning multi-tasker who&amp;rsquo;s easily distracted and likes instant gratification. High-S people also get stressed when placed in multi-tasking situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The C stands for Compliance or Caution. High-C people care a lot about the world&amp;rsquo;s rules, standards, and procedures, and they want to make sure they&amp;rsquo;re following the rules because they believe that provides safety. Low-C people think rules are for controlling other people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people are high in two dimensions and low in the other two. It&amp;rsquo;s a little less common, but people can be moderately high in a few, and I&amp;rsquo;ve even seen a few people who were high in three categories. Programmers, for example, tend to be high-S, high-C. Many salespeople are high-I and either high-D or high-S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find many places to take the DISC test, such as TTI Success Insights&amp;rsquo;s website, Tony Robbins&amp;rsquo;s website, and some of the free testing sites I linked above. I have taken lots of those tests and gotten almost exactly the same results from all of them, no matter which provider I used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also asked about 20 of my friends to take some of these tests and share the results with me so I could practice studying and understanding people&amp;rsquo;s personalities. I feel this has helped me be more observant and a better judge of character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TTI Success Insights and Tony Robbins&amp;rsquo;s test website both provide free DISC and Values tests. The benefit of adding the Values test is that the assessment tries to help you understand potential strengths and conflicts between the ways you like to behave, and the things that motivate you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Five tests are similar to DISC in some ways, but I don&amp;rsquo;t find it as easy to apply or understand. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say it is inaccurate, but it feels incomplete to me, as though some of the things it measures are secondary rather than primary, and there are some primary things missing (e.g. how aggressive someone is). This may be a function of how familiar I am with DISC, rather than an objective judgment of the models. To be fair, DISC doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem fully faithful in my experience either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivators-models&#34;&gt;Motivators Models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Values are the things a person cares about&amp;mdash;what motivates them. Unlike behaviors, which seem to be pretty steady for a lot of people over the long term, values are sometimes situationally driven and can change, especially with major life events such as getting married, having children, moving, or changing jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TTI&amp;rsquo;s motivators are theoretical, utilitarian, aesthetic, social, individualistic, and traditional. The InnerMetrix motivators (values) are aesthetic, economic, individualistic, political, altruistic, regulatory, and theoretical. Although they use similar names, I think the meanings are a bit different in some nuances. I don&amp;rsquo;t prefer one of these to the other, but I&amp;rsquo;m more familiar with the TTI assessments because I&amp;rsquo;ve used them a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: TTI&amp;rsquo;s new Driving Forces assessment is based off the motivators
assessment but is more nuanced and some of the items are renamed to reflect
that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example, using the TTI Driving Forces assessment. One of the
dimensions, Utilitarianism, varies between Selflessness and Resourcefulness.
Selfless - People who are driven by completing tasks for the greater good, with
little expectation of personal return.
Resourceful - People who are driven by practical results, maximizing both
efficiency and returns for their investments of time, talent, energy and
resources. In other words, resourceful people do things
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/intent/&#34;&gt;intentionally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dimension is what motivates how you behave towards others. Now called
Others, previously called Social, it ranges from
Altruistic (People who are driven to assist others for the satisfaction of
being helpful or supportive) to
Intentional (People who are driven to assist others for a specific purpose, not just for the sake of being helpful or supportive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these dimensions relate to the expected outcome of a decision or
activity: do you do it for the greater good, or to achieve a goal? I&amp;rsquo;ve found
this to be extremely revealing about people. It&amp;rsquo;s not to say one is good or bad;
all of these dimensions are good for different things. Picture an EMT versus a
hospice care nurse, or the way a real estate developer feels about a plot of
land versus how a biologist or forest service worker does. You can probably
predict which types of people are best suited for those jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matching people to jobs they&amp;rsquo;re naturally motivated to do results in
effortless, joyful work that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like work and never gets stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: After a few years using the TTI values assessment, now called Driving Forces, I have grown more and more impressed with it. Watching people react to their assessments hundreds of times, along with observing them in interview settings of 60-90 minutes or even longer, I have come to see it as extremely accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;strengths-assessments&#34;&gt;Strengths Assessments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an open topic of debate whether one should try to work with their strengths and ignore their weaknesses, or try to improve their weak points. Some, such as Drucker in his classic &lt;em&gt;Managing Oneself&lt;/em&gt;, argue that you should find your strengths and use them, because your weaknesses are often hard to improve. I believe that being aware of my weaknesses has helped me to improve some of the &amp;ldquo;low hanging fruit&amp;rdquo; over time, and some weak points are pretty easy to improve dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two projects that try to help people understand their strengths and weaknesses, and particularly their &lt;em&gt;most unique&lt;/em&gt; strengths and weaknesses, are the &lt;a href=&#34;http://strengths.gallup.com/&#34;&gt;StrengthsFinder 2.0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://standout.tmbc.com&#34;&gt;StandOut&lt;/a&gt; assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these have companion books. If you buy the book, you get a code that lets you take the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone recommended the StrengthsFinder book to me. To tell the truth I found it difficult to understand the results. There are way too many dimensions to the report and I don&amp;rsquo;t think all of them are clearly distinguished from each other, and the names and descriptions of them seem to be extremely general as well. Besides, they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to mean what they say; it&amp;rsquo;s as though the terms are redefined instead of using the accepted meanings of the words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did find the StandOut report to be more straightforward, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have found it interesting or highly useful on an ongoing basis. I seem to continue to return to the DISC and Values results for further study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also feel that the DISC and Values results are more well-developed and have benefited from being applied to many more people. For example, they&amp;rsquo;ve been used widely enough that they&amp;rsquo;re evaluated in context of a culture (the report takes into account whether you&amp;rsquo;re a Spanish-speaking American, for example). I think that provides a greater specificity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not use these assessments in hiring. I use TTI&amp;rsquo;s more advanced reports (competencies and worldviews), which are only available in the paid reports. But for low-cost reports I think StandOut is a reasonable one you can use on a personal basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-bhagavad-gita&#34;&gt;The Bhagavad-Gita&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now for something completely different!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personality profiling and categorization isn&amp;rsquo;t new. The Bhagavad-Gita&amp;rsquo;s last
third contains extensive discussion of the different types of people. It
separates them into three major categories, each influenced by a
&lt;em&gt;guna&lt;/em&gt; (strand or quality).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t take this seriously, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think the last third of this great text
is the most worthy of deep study. But it&amp;rsquo;s still fun and interesting in some
ways to think about how the author of the Gita categorizes people, their modes
of worship, their types of action, the kinds of foods they eat, and so on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the light of knowledge shines forth&lt;br&gt;
through all the gates of the body,&lt;br&gt;
then it is apparent&lt;br&gt;
that &lt;em&gt;sattva&lt;/em&gt; is the ruling trait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greed and constant activity,&lt;br&gt;
excessive projects, cravings,&lt;br&gt;
restlessness: these arise&lt;br&gt;
when &lt;em&gt;rajas&lt;/em&gt; is the ruling trait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darkness, dullness, stagnation,&lt;br&gt;
indolence, confusion, torpor,&lt;br&gt;
inertia: these appear&lt;br&gt;
when &lt;em&gt;tamas&lt;/em&gt; is the ruling trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This excerpt is from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Bhagavad-Gita-Translation-Stephen-Mitchell/dp/0609810340/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;Stephen Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s wonderful new translation of the
Bhagavad-Gita&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that the better-quality personality assessments are meaningful and useful, though not perfect. In my opinion they&amp;rsquo;re good tools for personal and professional development of oneself and others, as well as improving interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the TTI assessments professionally. I know people who use Caliper, Chally, and Criterion among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For personal use I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to suggest getting the free assessments from any of these, as well as the InnerMetrix ones from Tony Robbins&amp;rsquo;s website (which may also be available for free elsewhere too, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For professional use I would suggest working with an experienced management coach. These companies often have networks of certified professionals who are trained in administering and interpreting their assessments, as well as using them in an ongoing process of improvement. My coach is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eureconsulting.com/&#34;&gt;Brad Eure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote in quite a bit of detail about the use of personality assessments in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vividcortex.com/resources/building-scalable-dba-team/&#34;&gt;VividCortex&amp;rsquo;s ebook on building and managing a team of database administrators&lt;/a&gt;. That ebook contains actual data from volunteers who took the assessments. It may be interesting further reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;After a lot of further experience with personality tests in the
teams I manage, as well as taking many more tests myself, I am fully convinced
that the TTI Success Insights evaluations, especially the full battery of four
models, is the best on the market. These assessments use models that match human
behavior, values, etc very well. They are also extremely accurate. They resist
&amp;ldquo;gaming&amp;rdquo; and other types of manipulation. The more I use them the more impressed
I am. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2016/03/27/personality-assessment-values-profile/&#34;&gt;this blog
post&lt;/a&gt; for more on some
of the additional assessments beyond DISC and Values/Driving Forces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/06/05/maximize-productivity-in-three-easy-steps/&#34;&gt;last blog post&lt;/a&gt; I explained how to reclaim your mornings and make them the most productive time of day. In this one I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how exercise makes my mornings better, and how I avoid feeling sluggish after overdoing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/06/bokeh.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Bokeh&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I start, though, I am not a doctor, and by reading the following you agree you&amp;rsquo;re doing it at your own risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;exercise-and-the-payback&#34;&gt;Exercise And The Payback&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s any argument about the benefits of exercise. Exercise makes you happier, smarter, faster, more focused, and just generally makes everything better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found that intensity is what creates results for me. Short, all-out effort, usually no more than 15 minutes. I used to go to a Crossfit gym but now I just do Crossfit workouts at home, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/01/20/crossfit-safety/&#34;&gt;safely&lt;/a&gt;. (Their WODs are posted on the web.) I do these workouts in the morning before I go to the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trouble is, I have a little bit of a competitive streak. I can overdo it, especially if I&amp;rsquo;m feeling my oats and I have been traveling and not working out regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I can really end up feeling sore and tired the day after a hard workout. And on those days, I have a very noticeable slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I do to help avoid this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-no-coffee-after-noon&#34;&gt;1. No Coffee After Noon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not a big coffee drinker (though I am somewhat of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/01/24/ultimate-bargain-coffee-kit/&#34;&gt;coffee snob&lt;/a&gt;), but even a single cup of coffee or strong tea after noon can affect my sleep pretty dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve tested this to my satisfaction, noting how tired I feel in the morning versus how much coffee I had the day before, and so forth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caffeine seems to make my sleep much less restful, and I don&amp;rsquo;t recover from a hard workout as well when I have caffeine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I limit myself to a single cup, usually no later than 9:30am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-no-computer-screens-at-night&#34;&gt;2. No Computer Screens At Night&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at a computer, tablet, or cellphone (or even a TV) triggers hormone responses that suppress sleep, and prevent deep restful sleep even if you do get to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to spend my last hour or so looking at paper under incandescent light. Preferably doing something like drawing Zentangles or writing in my journal, to really get my mind off work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-take-fish-oil&#34;&gt;3. Take Fish Oil&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mileage may vary, but good quality fish oil is as good as aspirin in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-take-a-cold-shower&#34;&gt;4. Take a Cold Shower&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I end my shower with 30 seconds or so of cold water. Some people &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.getsidekick.com/blog/911-challenge-cold-showers&#34;&gt;suggest&lt;/a&gt; taking completely cold showers, but I find that the combination of hot and then cold seems to help me recover from a strenuous workout better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with a hot shower and ending with cold is like alternating a hot pack with an ice pack. It seems to reduce inflammation and flush out lactic acid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, a cold shower is a massive energy kick in the morning. To get the adrenaline boost that comes along with it, I breathe deeply and make sure I stay calm, not fighting the cold. I let the water run into my hair and chill my scalp. That really wakes me up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/06/abstract.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Abstract&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember what Tom Brown Jr. wrote in a book I read as a child: the cold does not bother me because it is real. Mind over matter: I decide it is just a feeling, and presto, it is just a feeling. Tom Brown Jr. may be a pathological liar, but hey, it works for me.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Boost Your Productivity In Three Easy Steps</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/06/05/maximize-productivity-in-three-easy-steps/</link>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re like a lot of knowledge workers, you might feel that you spend your
time unproductively. You seem to &amp;ldquo;do stuff&amp;rdquo; all day long but then
feel that you&amp;rsquo;ve done nothing but &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; at the end of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can you change this? I&amp;rsquo;ve found three things that work for me to not only
stay focused and achieve my objectives, but also help me feel better about
myself. You see, although on a less &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/07/05/on-focus/&#34;&gt;focused&lt;/a&gt; day I
might not &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; very productive, it&amp;rsquo;s not that I&amp;rsquo;ve failed to achieve anything
(though I might have achieved fewer of my most valuable goals). It&amp;rsquo;s that I&amp;rsquo;ve
worked with an unclear mind, and later cannot remember exactly what I did during
the day. This leads directly to self-doubt and self-criticism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/06/sky.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sky&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solving this problem is fairly simple for me and results in terrific
productivity, as well as a great sense of satisfaction and progress at the end
of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important not only to achieve what you desire, but to feel great about it
too. Marten Mickos, whose
&lt;a href=&#34;http://schoolofherring.com/2015/03/12/how-to-sleep-well-at-night/&#34;&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; is
always worth reading, says this about getting a good night&amp;rsquo;s sleep:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what you can do so that you are able to work hard and sleep well&amp;hellip;
[In the evening] forgive yourself all your failures and weaknesses. Accept who
you are and be kind to yourself and others. This helps to get reach the peace
of mind a good nights sleep requires.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Edit: here&amp;rsquo;s a comment from Rob Young on Facebook that I just had to share
here. &amp;ldquo;The only thing I would add to the first tip is to at least
attempt to forgive others as well. It may take time, but I try to let others&amp;rsquo;
transgressions go as soon as my heart/mind will allow. And always be kind to
all in all ways.&amp;rdquo; Thanks, Rob &amp;ndash; these are such wise words.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, here are the three simple steps that have made a world of
difference for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-choose-tomorrow-s-priorities-tonight&#34;&gt;1. Choose Tomorrow&amp;rsquo;s Priorities Tonight&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, after supper and the kids are in bed and everyone&amp;rsquo;s going
separate ways, while everything you&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about all day long is
tumbling restlessly around in your mind, take this simple, concrete step to
clear your mind for a good night&amp;rsquo;s sleep and make tomorrow the best it can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Settle quietly and do things away from your normal daytime routine (computers,
social media, and the like). Do something, even for just a few minutes, to
really shift gears. Draw or play music or write in a journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then find a small piece of paper. A standard Post-It note is ideal, much better
than a notebook that&amp;rsquo;s full of cluttered ideas and distractions. On this piece
of paper, write a TODO list of everything that comes to you. All the things that
have bothered you through the day. What do you need or want to do? Write it:
board meeting, update HR handbook, refactor APIs, dry cleaning. If you&amp;rsquo;ve kept a
scrap of paper in your back pocket and readied this list already through the
day, so much the better. Review and enlarge it if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re done, choose things you think you can accomplish in the morning
tomorrow, and which are your most important and strategic. Either they&amp;rsquo;re time
sensitive and need to be done, or they&amp;rsquo;re a huge lever for the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/06/tree.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Tree&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Write these things on a new, fresh Post-It note. It should be no more than a
handful of things. If you have more than 5, I think you should question whether
you have your priorities right, but you might be different from me. Make your
note clean and uncluttered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put this Post-It note inside the lid of your laptop or day planner. Put it in
the way of whatever you might otherwise impulsively do first in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many benefits result from doing this. It&amp;rsquo;s a good use of your time when you&amp;rsquo;re
tired and can&amp;rsquo;t work at peak productivity, it empties your mind and lets you go
to sleep peacefully, it captures things you&amp;rsquo;d otherwise forget, and most of all
it sets you up for maximum productivity when you can best make use of it, as
you&amp;rsquo;ll see next. All in all, I think it&amp;rsquo;s perhaps one of the best things you can
possibly do with your evening time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a corollary, I think one of the &lt;strong&gt;worst&lt;/strong&gt; times you can try to think about
priorities is the morning. In the morning, your mind is empty of context. You
can&amp;rsquo;t remember all the things you might want or need to factor into
priority-setting. &lt;strong&gt;Do this in the evening.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now close down all the windows and tabs you don&amp;rsquo;t need. Close your email and
social media. Close chat and messenger programs. Close everything. In the
morning you will have your Post-It note and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spend the rest of your evening quietly, away from computers and tablets and
other harsh stimuli that will mess with your retinas and suppress sleep
hormones. Go to bed at a good time and pace, and sleep well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-eat-a-big-breakfast&#34;&gt;2. Eat A Big Breakfast&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the worst things you can do in the morning is set yourself up to be
hungry and irritable before lunch. Eat a breakfast that will keep food and
hunger far from your mind until it is time for your next meal. This will remove
a huge distraction from your morning. After all, what&amp;rsquo;s more distracting than a
physical need? When you&amp;rsquo;re hungry, don&amp;rsquo;t you want to wander around restlessly,
changing whatever you&amp;rsquo;re doing because your body says &amp;ldquo;do something different
than what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, which is causing hunger?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/06/flower.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Flower&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have experimented carefully and found that fats and proteins are the best for
me. Two of my favorites are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scrambled eggs slow-cooked with lots of butter, and perhaps some cheese.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smoothies with items such as peanut butter, protein powder, avocado, and yogurt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I eat something carb-heavy, such as a pancake, I like to drench it with
coconut oil, butter, or spread it with peanut butter or yogurt to help me digest
it slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People are incredibly different and we do not all run on the same engines and
fuels. Find out what works for you. (That applies to this entire article,
too. However, the advice in this article has proven true for many of my friends
and acquaintances, so I feel comfortable giving it.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-make-morning-time-sacred&#34;&gt;3. Make Morning Time Sacred&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I omitted part of Marten Mickos&amp;rsquo;s quote before:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you wake up in the morning, push yourself to be dissatisfied and highly
ambitious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe you are different, but most people I know agree that morning is
their most productive time. With your mind newly cleared after your subconscious
has dealt with stress and conflict through productive dreaming and imagery, you
are at your best for several hours in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make this time sacred. Do everything to avoid wasting it. Common wastes of time
include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking social media&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reading email, news, and the like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Going to meetings or participating in calls&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Above all, &lt;strong&gt;trying to decide what you should be doing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you&amp;rsquo;ll recognize that feeling of &amp;ldquo;I have a hundred things to
do, but I can&amp;rsquo;t think of a single thing I should be doing! What should I do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why you take step 1 to prepare for these precious hours of maximum
output. The second and third steps ensure that nothing gets in the way of this
time.  Once you&amp;rsquo;ve planned your goals and priorities, you want to
focus ruthlessly on those things when you&amp;rsquo;re most productive. Block out time
on your calendar routinely to prevent interruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about this: what&amp;rsquo;s on your calendar? Do you schedule your &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; or do you
schedule &lt;em&gt;interruptions to your work&lt;/em&gt;? Is that really how you want it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/06/snowflake.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Snowflake&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are physically and mentally ready to make the most efficient use of your
morning, and you&amp;rsquo;ve decided what to focus on so you don&amp;rsquo;t waste a moment
thinking about it, then the only thing remaining is to ensure that no one but
you owns your morning time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to take ownership and control of your schedule or others will do it
for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;in-conclusion&#34;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pick the right time of day to do the right things, and ensure you take care of
your physical and mental needs so you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to devote yourself wholly to
them. Good sleep and a clear mind are essential. So is a daily cycle of planning
when you&amp;rsquo;re best at planning, preparing in advance for productive working time,
and blocking out distractions during that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve taken these three steps, the only thing remaining is to actually use
the time you&amp;rsquo;ve dedicated to the goals you&amp;rsquo;ve decided to prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open your computer and remove the Post-It note from the keyboard or screen.
Review briefly the few things you decided last night to focus on. Pick one, and
one only. Push it to completion. Let nothing else distract you. Do not open
email or other time-wasters. Close your door, work from home, whatever it takes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have some specific suggestions about integrating exercise and
physical wellness into your daily rhythm for maximum impact. I will share that
in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you try my suggestions, please use the comments to let me know how it works
for you, and what other suggestions you have.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>On Focus</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/07/05/on-focus/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 05 Jul 2014 00:00:00 UTC</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/07/05/on-focus/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Focus is perhaps the most important attribute in an organization. In fact, my dictionary defines an organization as &amp;ldquo;an organized body of people with a particular purpose&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; A focused organization recognizes and cleaves to its purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the ability to create and sustain focus is perhaps the most valuable skill of the organization&amp;rsquo;s members, including both individual contributors and leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/05/rainbokeh.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Rainbokeh&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-focus-and-why-is-it-hard&#34;&gt;What Is Focus, And Why Is It Hard?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dictionary says focus is &amp;ldquo;an act of concentrating.&amp;rdquo; Consider the root words: &lt;em&gt;concentrate&lt;/em&gt; literally means to bring to a common center, to be centered together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, I think of focus as a &lt;em&gt;resource&lt;/em&gt; similar to time, money, goodwill, and other more-or-less-fungible things. I claim that focus is usually an organization&amp;rsquo;s most valuable, most threatened, and scarcest resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I base this claim on my life experience. I have never worked at an organization that was too focused. I have never heard anyone describe an organization objectively as doing too few things too thoroughly, prioritizing excellence in execution too highly. Focus always seems to be under pressure; there always seems to be a gravitational pull away from focus, towards distraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this? I believe it&amp;rsquo;s because ideas can be conceived in a flash, but execution takes time. In a moment of inspiration, I can envision a completed product or project. I can allow myself the thrill of dreaming about the benefits. How much better life would be with this-or-that! How much I would enjoy that! How much I&amp;rsquo;d like the satisfaction of having achieved this utopian ideal, this perfection!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sobering reality is that achieving such a vision takes a long time and goes through many unexpected detours. Focus is hard precisely because inspiration is fleeting. We&amp;rsquo;re drawn into the tedious, neverending details of execution, yet the goal appears to remain as far away as ever. We long for the satisfaction of accomplishment, and it&amp;rsquo;s human to desire it &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the middle of this struggle, this discipline of delaying gratification, it&amp;rsquo;s so tempting to daydream of new ideas again. It&amp;rsquo;s rewarding because the indulgence of &amp;ldquo;wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be wonderful&amp;rdquo; thoughts actually creates surges of pleasure responses such as endorphins. Distraction is an enticing, seductive drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fear-is-anti-focus&#34;&gt;Fear Is Anti-Focus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be demotivating to acknowledge the reality that achieving the dream is a marathon, not a sprint. This is actually a fear response. The thought &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll never finish&lt;/em&gt; is a lie; the truth is &lt;em&gt;I fear I&amp;rsquo;ll never finish&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, many of the reasons it can be hard to focus are just fear in different guises. New ideas are alluring in part due to the fear of what might happen if you don&amp;rsquo;t pursue them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If I don&amp;rsquo;t do this new thing I&amp;rsquo;ve just thought about, someone else will do it first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I might forget my new idea, or the reasons that I think it&amp;rsquo;s good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;I might lose the opportunity to do it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fear is the voice of a pathological liar in your head. Fear says &lt;em&gt;this is real&lt;/em&gt; when the truth is &lt;em&gt;this isn&amp;rsquo;t real yet, but it could become real, and I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like it if it did.&lt;/em&gt; You can see this by noting that fears are always about a potential future; if it&amp;rsquo;s reality already, you might suffer, but you won&amp;rsquo;t fear. And fears are not about the circumstance, but about your projected response to it. I wrote &lt;em&gt;wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like&lt;/em&gt; above, but the truth is &lt;em&gt;might not like&lt;/em&gt;. For example, the correct translation of &lt;em&gt;I fear getting old&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;I fear that I might get old, and if I do, I might not like it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the appeal of a new idea is often partially infused with urgency, based on fear of what might happen if you don&amp;rsquo;t pursue the idea, and how you imagine you might feel about that outcome if it comes to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/05/perfection.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Perfection&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;focus-is-worth-striving-for&#34;&gt;Focus Is Worth Striving For&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benefit of focusing is simple: efficiency. The more concentrated your efforts, the more effective they&amp;rsquo;ll be. Your results will appear sooner, your work will flow more joyfully and easily, and your outcome will be better quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you examine some of the effects of distraction, the benefits of focus should become clear. I won&amp;rsquo;t belabor this point, but I&amp;rsquo;ll note that every new activity or idea has a compound effect. We tend to be biased to see the potential benefits much more than the likely drawbacks, which is part of why new ideas are so alluring. We see, for example, that a new product feature will enrich and enable and empower. But do we see that to do it right, we&amp;rsquo;re obligated to integrate it smoothly with all existing and future product features, to maintain it, to test it, to train, to document, to support? &lt;a href=&#34;http://firstround.com/article/the-one-cost-engineers-and-product-managers-dont-consider&#34;&gt;Usually not&lt;/a&gt;. We usually see compound benefits, but neglect to see compounded costs and risks, especially those that come from failure to execute fully and excellently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus is putting what’s most important first and protecting its right to be there.
(typically by saying &amp;ldquo;No&amp;rdquo; to everything else) &amp;mdash; &lt;a href=&#34;http://vanessahurst.com/post/83405785577/focus-is-putting-whats-most-important-first-and&#34;&gt;Vanessa Hurst&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people I admire achieve amazing things precisely because they complete one thing and then build something new on top of it, rather than always having everything in a glorious state of perfect incompletion. The &amp;ldquo;secret&amp;rdquo; to their success is the willpower to patiently bring things to completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, I often think about focus in terms of WIP (work-in-progress), a term you&amp;rsquo;ll hear in Lean, Agile, Kanban, and other circles. Focus and WIP are inversely related. Focus is the ability to say &amp;ldquo;not yet,&amp;rdquo; to finish work in progress before starting new things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The danger of not doing this &amp;mdash; the danger of saying yes to opportunity &amp;mdash; is that you&amp;rsquo;ll load so much gold into the boat that you sink the whole thing. I find it helpful to consider each new opportunity or idea from this perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you have too much focus? Certainly, but it&amp;rsquo;s not focus. It&amp;rsquo;s perfectionism, which is another type of fear. In my experience, individuals can be perfectionists, but organizations &amp;mdash; I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen that. And even perfectionist individuals suffer from a perverse lack of focus, because they focus on the perfection of the thing they want to achieve, rather than the benefits they want to achieve. Focusing on the benefits you want is an antidote to perfectionism. I write from deep personal experience on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to point out that the type of execution-to-completion I&amp;rsquo;m discussing is emphatically not anti-Agile. Shipping early and often is part of getting something to completion as soon as possible, achieving the best final product, and lowering waste. Completion and excellence in execution are often conflated with perfectionism and reluctance to release partial work. They&amp;rsquo;re not the same, and treating them as synonymous is a huge mistake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-politics-of-focus&#34;&gt;The Politics Of Focus&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a manager, it can be difficult to help your team stay focused, because you need to coach them through their natural impatience and discouragement without demotivating them. This is no easy thing, but nobody said management is easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although it&amp;rsquo;s true that &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paperplanes.de/2014/6/2/focus-starts-by-saying-no.html&#34;&gt;focus starts with saying no&lt;/a&gt;, say it carefully. Someone who has a good idea that is struck down can easily take it personally, especially if the idea was rejected ingraciously. It helps to put the emphasis on the idea and not the person. It also helps to take the emphasis &lt;em&gt;away&lt;/em&gt; from the idea and draw it back towards the work in progress, and the outcome you&amp;rsquo;re working for &amp;mdash; to redirect the conversation into a &amp;ldquo;yes&amp;rdquo; for something else, instead of saying &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; to the idea itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion is to avoid saying &amp;ldquo;no&amp;rdquo; and to say &amp;ldquo;yes, later&amp;rdquo; instead. This is itself a way of focusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/05/fossil.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Shell&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reminding people of the progress they&amp;rsquo;re making can also be helpful. While you&amp;rsquo;re in the weeds executing on a vision, progress becomes difficult to see. If you can help people remember what things were like a month ago, they might be reminded of how much progress they&amp;rsquo;re making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another helpful reminder is that the distracting idea or opportunity isn&amp;rsquo;t a good thing &lt;em&gt;yet&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s only the vision of the possibility of a good thing. This can segue nicely into rekindling passion for what&amp;rsquo;s currently underway:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember all the superior effort you&amp;rsquo;ve put into what you&amp;rsquo;ve done thus far, but which isn&amp;rsquo;t yet producing any benefit? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice to see that through? Can you remember the original vision for that project, and how excited we were about making that a reality?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be patient with people who have ideas you don&amp;rsquo;t want to pursue right away. Let them work through the ideas with you, help them come to terms with any fears (conscious or not), and use their passion and enthusiasm as a springboard for redirecting energy into the current project. Nothing kills the &lt;em&gt;esprit de corps&lt;/em&gt; quite as fast as a naysayer who just shuts things down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;evaluating-opportunities&#34;&gt;Evaluating Opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many ideas and opportunities &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; worth considering seriously, and some are worth pursuing. Through experience I&amp;rsquo;ve stumbled onto a model that has worked for me thus far. It&amp;rsquo;s based on two questions that require considerable thought and care:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are the current efforts and work-in-progress producing good outcomes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If we do more of the same (i.e. execute to the vision), will we magnify our existing success?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the answers are yes, then it might not be best to engage in new ideas or opportunities, no matter how good they are. Beware of loading your plate with more than you need to eat. Ask yourself two additional questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are boredom and missed opportunities the only risks of staying the course we&amp;rsquo;ve set?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are novelty and expanded opportunity the main benefits of beginning something new?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;worldview&#34;&gt;Worldview&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Focused organizations are made of focused people. It&amp;rsquo;s that simple. If your people can&amp;rsquo;t focus, then the organization will be less focused. If they can, then the organization can be single-minded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking personally, my patience and ability to continue working on things that are in progress, and my reluctance to admit distraction, is not something I was born with. Remaining serene and keeping an eye on the goal is a skill that I believe anyone can nurture and grow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, it&amp;rsquo;s now part of my underlying worldview. I believe, and my experience has been, that whatever I focus on, whatever I give my attention to, will gradually become my reality. I believe that mindfulness &amp;mdash; the ability to observe choose my thoughts, and by proxy to direct my thoughts intentionally &amp;mdash; is the source of my ability to direct my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2014/05/cityscape.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cityscape&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was a child, I attended a workshop with Pat Parelli, a master horseman and trainer of people. His phrase has stayed with me through many years:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Causing is somewhere between making and letting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I notice and release distracting thoughts, what is it but focus? When I choose my thoughts with care and intention, what is this other than focus?  And every time I do this, I &lt;em&gt;cause&lt;/em&gt; myself to contribute to my desired goals, by training myself to become better at giving attention to things I want, and withdrawing attention from things I don&amp;rsquo;t want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-advice&#34;&gt;My Advice&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My advice, should you wish to hear it, is to consider that mental effort defeats itself. You can&amp;rsquo;t force yourself to focus. The harder you try, the more you&amp;rsquo;ll spin your wheels. It must be effortless and relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One way to avoid effort is to become interested in what you want. The ability to create genuine interest within yourself is a skill. You can do it if you can direct your thoughts to the things you want. And training yourself to be able to direct your thoughts is not only possible, it&amp;rsquo;s the single most valuable skill you could ever acquire, because it will multiply your efforts in every other area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than fighting or working for focus, I suggest that you become a focused person through a daily practice of your choosing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone&amp;rsquo;s practice will be different. The key is to find something that works for you, and is so rewarding that you find it indispensable &amp;mdash; something you &amp;ldquo;couldn&amp;rsquo;t live without.&amp;rdquo; If you don&amp;rsquo;t know where to start, ask advice from people you admire. If you want what they have gotten, consider doing what they have done. Look at anyone else in your life and assess them the same way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll give a couple of examples. One is mindfulness and meditation. For an example, see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.feld.com/wp/archives/2014/04/meditation-narrative.html&#34;&gt;Brad Feld&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;. He has written a great deal about the benefits he&amp;rsquo;s seen since beginning to practice meditation. His personal practice is based on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.getsomeheadspace.com/&#34;&gt;Headspace Project&lt;/a&gt;, which I can also say has worked well for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example is Martin Luther (not Martin Luther King Jr), who is quoted as saying &amp;ldquo;I have so much to do that I shall spend the first three hours in prayer.&amp;rdquo; Beginning each day with intentionality gets things off on the right foot. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that three hours is necessary for everyone. Three minutes works wonders for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third is physical activity. Many people find specific things conducive to focus: running, knitting, swimming, showering. If you can get some focus and quietude of mind doing something like that, then try to integrate it into the rest of your time as well. For me, it used to be rock climbing. That was the only time I felt focused.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I use both prayer and meditation to achieve mindfulness every day and carry it through all my activities. Years ago I met an elderly man, an architect, who spoke of his lifelong practice of transcendental meditation and how beneficial it had been. I asked him to be my teacher, and he spent a lot of time coaching me in meditation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately I found I could not sustain the practice he passed on to me. Perhaps it was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t learn it well enough, or perhaps it just wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite right for me. Whatever the reason, it was something I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; live without, and because it was non-essential I gradually drifted out of the habit of doing it every day. After some time I found two small tweaks that made it much easier for me, and that made all the difference. (The tweaks were meditating for a slightly shorter time, and focusing on my breath instead of a mantra. Your mileage will vary.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find the following pieces of scripture immensely inspiring:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light. &amp;mdash; Matthew 6:21-22&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean for one&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;eye to be single&lt;/em&gt;? My interpretation is that it means to cast your attention on only one thing. The overall meaning I find in these verses is that choosing a goal, choosing to regard your goal as a treasure you desire, and concentrating on it, will motivate you towards creating that outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, this is the essence of focus for me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be still, and know that I am God.
&amp;mdash; Psalm 46:10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish you success in all your endeavours, and hope you&amp;rsquo;ve found this article helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I joined Percona, my work/life balance has changed. I used to work eight-hour days and go home, period. Now I find it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes difficult to keep good boundaries between work and the rest of my life. I also found that 8 hours in my new job left me much more tired than 8 in my old job. I&amp;rsquo;ve had to really work hard to understand what changed and how to keep this more in balance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2009/09/newtons-cradle.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Newton&#39;s Cradle&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten help from a number of other people. In the end, a deep examination of my habits was necessary. After all that work, I thought it might be helpful to share the results with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-changed&#34;&gt;What changed?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of things changed from my old office job to my new work-at-home job. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to believe these are the key factors involved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working at home&lt;/strong&gt;. Working from a home office means I don&amp;rsquo;t have a clear physical boundary between me and my job. I have a dedicated office space &amp;ndash; I don&amp;rsquo;t work from my living space, generally speaking. But even that isn&amp;rsquo;t enough. The computer is just there in the other room &amp;ndash; I could stop in on my way to the kitchen and see whether that long-running job is done, couldn&amp;rsquo;t I?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No easy excuses&lt;/strong&gt;. The convenience of having my office just down the hall, and always having a work telephone nearby, removes a number of psychological safeguards that used to protect my private life from intrusions at work. Most of these safeguards were subconscious. If someone asked me &amp;ldquo;Can you attend this conference call at 8PM?&amp;rdquo; the answer used to be &amp;ldquo;no, I go home at 5PM.&amp;rdquo; I never realized how strong a barrier that is. Now that it&amp;rsquo;s gone, I have to actually say &amp;ldquo;I &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; not to do what you are asking me to do.&amp;rdquo; The people-pleasing, confrontation-avoiding part of me finds this hard to do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International clients, many clients&lt;/strong&gt;. Working with customers in different timezones is challenging. Sometimes people are literally on the other side of the world, and there is zero overlap between our normal work hours. Most of the work we do is in smaller bits, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to have to work with several clients in different timezones every day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International teammates&lt;/strong&gt;. Like our clients, our team is distributed. It&amp;rsquo;s spread from eastern Russia to California. Team meetings, conference calls, working together with another person on a task &amp;ndash; all add pressure on the 8-hour day. Without accommodating people&amp;rsquo;s schedules, one is reduced to email with a huge delay built in &amp;ndash; if I get up and don&amp;rsquo;t answer email from Novosibirsk right away, that colleague might be in bed by the time I do reply to it, and we&amp;rsquo;re going to have a communication bandwidth of about 2 emails per day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning new things&lt;/strong&gt;. A lot of what I&amp;rsquo;m doing is new to me. Technically, there simply isn&amp;rsquo;t any traditional job in the world that exposes you to the variety of things we see. The amount of new things to learn is staggering in every way. Managerially, I&amp;rsquo;m not experienced at leading a distributed team (and not many other people in the world are, either, so there&amp;rsquo;s comparatively little help out there). Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m just not as productive in some areas, because I&amp;rsquo;m constantly climbing new, steep learning curves. Things pile up and create stress, and that creates pressure to get more stuff done, which strains the length of the workday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having fun&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve never had this much fun in my life. This is a very rewarding job. I feel I&amp;rsquo;m making more of a difference, putting my talents to use better, growing faster, and learning more than I ever have. Additionally, the difference between work and hobby is very unclear sometimes. Is Maatkit work or play? It&amp;rsquo;s hard to stop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those are the main factors that I found at the root of longer work hours. Now let&amp;rsquo;s see some strategies I&amp;rsquo;ve adopted to help bring this back to a more comfortable place, spending fewer hours and making them less draining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;strategy-1-flex-the-time&#34;&gt;Strategy 1: Flex the time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning what to change begins with learning what is in my control. One thing that&amp;rsquo;s not in my control (given that I keep the job I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen) is the reality that clients and colleagues are all over the world. Working effectively with them is going to be nearly-to-fully impossible in any given block of 8 hours. I might need to be up at 5AM or even earlier for one person, and stay up until 10PM or later for another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key insight here, which I missed for a long time, is that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I need to work from 5AM to 10PM continuously. So I do four things to keep the hours-at-the-keyboard down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Break up the day. I might start work early in the morning, sign off and go for a run, come back and work a little while, take a long lunch and spend time with my wife, go meet a friend, come back, work some more, take a nap, and do a little more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meet in the middle. I ask other people, including clients, to accommodate a little, too. I show up early, they stay up late. Likewise, I don&amp;rsquo;t try to hold myself to an ideal standard. I&amp;rsquo;m not always going to be there. We&amp;rsquo;re going to have some overlap, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be with them &amp;ldquo;enough,&amp;rdquo; but not as much as they might like. We&amp;rsquo;re not in the same timezone, so we don&amp;rsquo;t get 8 shared hours period, and halfway-between is good enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stagger the days. If I&amp;rsquo;m going to be doing something early one day, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to schedule the late work for another day, and take off early. Other days I&amp;rsquo;ll just start late, and do non-work things in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Schedule the time. Scheduling specific times &amp;ndash; exact times, from X to Y, literally on the calendar, is a huge help. I know what the personal-productivity books tell you: distinguish between tasks and appointments; never-ever-ever schedule tasks/obligations on the calendar. But seriously, things have to be planned, and you have to allocate time for them. If you don&amp;rsquo;t add them to a calendar and see how much time they add up to, how are you going to prevent yourself from overbooking and know when you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to get things done? My experience has been the exact opposite of what the personal-productivity gurus recommend. If I have some tasks to do, I&amp;rsquo;m going to block out time to do them, and that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m going to work on during that time. I&amp;rsquo;m about 50% good at this, I&amp;rsquo;d say. I&amp;rsquo;m not too rigid; I&amp;rsquo;m diligent enough to be reasonably effective; I leave time for unexpected things; and I have more improvement to do still.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Calendar rocks, by the way. I rely very heavily on it. It&amp;rsquo;s the best such tool I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;strategy-2-minimize-peripheral-things&#34;&gt;Strategy 2: Minimize peripheral things&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t try to &amp;ldquo;friend&amp;rdquo; me on Facebook, because I&amp;rsquo;m not there. Gadgets, gizmos, services and &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo; all occupy time. I try to keep things as minimal as I can. I look for ways to have fewer things to carry, plug in, lose, find, remember passwords for, check up on, etc. I use LinkedIn, but probably less than 20 times a year. I don&amp;rsquo;t use any other social networks. (I have a Facebook account but I completely ignore it. It&amp;rsquo;s only there so I can test-drive apps for clients.) I don&amp;rsquo;t text-message people except (rarely) for business, probably 10 times a year. I don&amp;rsquo;t follow people&amp;rsquo;s blogs, I don&amp;rsquo;t keep up with mailing lists, I generally don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;do&amp;rdquo; Twitter. I speed-read the few blogs I subscribe to in Google Reader &amp;ndash; usually I don&amp;rsquo;t read them at all, and I&amp;rsquo;m more likely to unsubscribe than to subscribe to anything. My nearly-constant mantra is &lt;em&gt;less is more&lt;/em&gt;. Heck, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have a cellphone until last year, and I&amp;rsquo;d get rid of it if I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;strategy-3-prefer-quality-time&#34;&gt;Strategy 3: Prefer quality time&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spending time with people is important, but not all time is equal. These days, I usually choose to talk with people by voice. I&amp;rsquo;ve found this much better than email, IRC, etc. That&amp;rsquo;s scattered, accidental time with very little value. People know that &amp;ndash; they value it cheaply. Phone or VOIP calls are concentrated, quality time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;strategy-4-separate-work-and-life&#34;&gt;Strategy 4: Separate work and life&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of things I do are so similar for work, hobby and life that it&amp;rsquo;s hard to keep them separate. Got personal email? Yep. Got work email? Yep. They&amp;rsquo;re the same, right? Email is email, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No they aren&amp;rsquo;t, and conflating them has a high cost. Work email is for work, and personal email is not. If I sent personal mail through my work account, I&amp;rsquo;d paint myself into a corner. Suppose I wanted to make plans to meet my brother and go to an event. If I sent that email from my work account, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to check for his response without also looking at a bunch of work email. Similarly, if I let a client use my personal email address, I&amp;rsquo;d never have any peace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep the two rigorously separate. Not only do I have different accounts, but I don&amp;rsquo;t even have them in the same program. I use a browser-based email for personal accounts, and I use Thunderbird for work, and never the twain shall meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have only one computer, because I think the environmental cost of a computer makes it unacceptable to have a separate one for work and personal, but I make sure work &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t auto-start on my computer. When I start my browser, it goes to my personal email. (I actually have different browser profiles for work and personal, too). When I start up, Skype doesn&amp;rsquo;t start. IRC doesn&amp;rsquo;t start. Email doesn&amp;rsquo;t start. All of these things have to be explicitly started up when I want to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;strategy-5-don-t-multi-task&#34;&gt;Strategy 5: Don&amp;rsquo;t multi-task&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People talk all the time about multi-tasking. The truth is, most people can&amp;rsquo;t do it at all &amp;ndash; not even a little bit. (See that car swerving in the lane ahead of you?) No &amp;ndash; what we do is switch among tasks. So-called multi-tasking is really fragmenting your attention. It is one of the best ways to kill productivity. It&amp;rsquo;s also extremely disrespectful, not only to the other drivers on the road, but to the other person on the phone, or the client who&amp;rsquo;s paying you hundreds of dollars an hour. How would you feel if you were paying someone for premium services and he was Skype-chatting with someone else on your nickel?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I&amp;rsquo;m going to have pressure on my time, and fall behind, and all the things I talked about earlier, then at least I&amp;rsquo;m going to try make my time as productive as I can. I try to do one and only one thing at a time. (This is probably more important for me than for most people. I am far less capable of paying attention to several things at once than other people I know &amp;ndash; just try to have a conversation with me when there&amp;rsquo;s a TV on nearby, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found that multi-tasking was &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; cause of the high emotional and physical drain in my new job. A day of multi-tasking leaves me tense, irritable, tired, distracted &amp;ndash; basically stressed out to the point of being worthless. A day of single-tasking is pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I avoid multi-tasking in two ways. Number one, by minimizing &amp;ldquo;stuff,&amp;rdquo; as I talked about earlier. I have as few gadgets, services, tools, and other clutter as I can get away with. Number two, by making these as unobtrusive as I can, which I&amp;rsquo;ll talk about next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;strategy-6-ignore-things-and-people&#34;&gt;Strategy 6: Ignore things and people&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t understand who invented balloon notifications. Everything has them these days: Skype, Pidgin, email programs. Skype even wants to nag you when people have birthdays! The first thing I do is turn them off. I get no notification of people coming online or offline, no notification of incoming email &amp;ndash; nothing. The exceptions are: when someone calls me in Skype I see a call dialog so I can actually accept the call, and when someone pings me on the company IRC channel my tray icon blinks. (I haven&amp;rsquo;t figured out yet how to disable blinking per-channel.) I also have every possible privacy guard configured; by default, I want to be invisible on Skype, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it&amp;rsquo;s time to check email, I&amp;rsquo;ll switch to Thunderbird. Actually, it&amp;rsquo;s just as likely that I&amp;rsquo;ll &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; Thunderbird &amp;ndash; I&amp;rsquo;m likely to shut it down instead of just minimizing it. When it&amp;rsquo;s time to chat with someone, I&amp;rsquo;ll open Skype and look to see if they&amp;rsquo;re online. Again, it&amp;rsquo;s actually more likely that I&amp;rsquo;ll send them an email and schedule a time to talk with them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people have their computers configured to talk to them. When I&amp;rsquo;m calling them I&amp;rsquo;ll send them a link through a chat program, and I hear &amp;ldquo;MESSAGE FROM BARON! AITCH TEE TEE PEE COLON SLASH SLASH DOUBLE YOU DOUBLE YOU DOUBLE YOU DOT &amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo; in the background. I would murder my computer if it did that to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also don&amp;rsquo;t let people casually interrupt me. My favorite example of this is Skype. People see me online, and they open a chat window and say &amp;ldquo;hi baron&amp;rdquo;. &lt;em&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re generally not going to get a reply.&lt;/em&gt; Maybe if I said &amp;ldquo;hi&amp;rdquo; back, they&amp;rsquo;d say &amp;ldquo;have you finished configuring server2 yet?&amp;rdquo; Or &amp;ldquo;we are going to need you guys to help, we&amp;rsquo;re creating a new Facebook app and it&amp;rsquo;s going to take about 100 hours of work.&amp;rdquo; Or maybe they&amp;rsquo;d say &amp;ldquo;o hai, u can haz cheezburger?&amp;rdquo; They need to start with &amp;ldquo;here&amp;rsquo;s what I want from you,&amp;rdquo; not &amp;ldquo;hi.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saying &amp;ldquo;hi&amp;rdquo; is implicitly saying &amp;ldquo;if you reply, you agree that you&amp;rsquo;re available right now, and you grant me permission to interrupt you, even though you don&amp;rsquo;t know what I&amp;rsquo;m going to interrupt you about.&amp;rdquo; And my non-response is me implicitly saying &amp;ldquo;Tell me what you want, and I&amp;rsquo;ll reply if now&amp;rsquo;s a good time to talk about it.&amp;rdquo; Actually, if they check my little mood message, they&amp;rsquo;ll see this: &amp;ldquo;Please tell me what you want. I am unlikely to respond to &amp;lsquo;hi&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;. And when I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; respond, I&amp;rsquo;m following my own rule: yes I am available now, and you are not interrupting me. Oh, I also say &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m on the phone&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I only have 5 minutes&amp;rdquo; right up-front.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may sound rude, but it&amp;rsquo;s not. My clients know that the proper way to interact is through our issue-tracking system, and my colleagues know that I&amp;rsquo;ll either get back to them when I can, or they can send email. Ignoring intrusions like this is actually the &lt;em&gt;polite&lt;/em&gt; thing to do. How many times have you been at a counter conducting some business, and the person behind the counter interrupts you to pick up the phone? &lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; is rude. I was there first. Somehow we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten this backwards idea that it&amp;rsquo;s good manners to interrupt a person because a device is making noise. I also believe that people subconsciously get the message: &amp;ldquo;hey, Baron isn&amp;rsquo;t available now because he&amp;rsquo;s working with someone else. But I can feel good about that, because when he&amp;rsquo;s working with me, I know I&amp;rsquo;ll have his undivided attention.&amp;rdquo; This matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I digress, but not much. My point is that doing one thing at a time, steadfastly refusing interruptions (with appropriate judgment applied given the context of who and what&amp;rsquo;s going on, of course), is the polite, respectful, and productive thing to do &amp;ndash; and one of the best ways I&amp;rsquo;ve found to achieve this is to mercilessly turn off all the attention-getting features of the tools I use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that I have a long ways to go, but I think I&amp;rsquo;ve figured out what&amp;rsquo;s wrong, and the last few months seem to be making a difference for me. I spend less time at the computer, I work more productively, and I feel a lot better &amp;ndash; after a day at work I usually feel fresh and energized, as I used to. These days I am able to make time to do things I haven&amp;rsquo;t done for years, such as playing music. I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to pay attention and find places to improve, but a working recipe for me so far seems to be introducing flexibility, minimizing distractions, keeping things separate, and maximizing personal interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
