        If you&rsquo;ve been holding out for that golden opportunity, now&rsquo;s a great time to get involved in Maatkit.
Until now I haven&rsquo;t really made a conscious effort to open-source the decision process and get people involved; Maatkit has been largely driven by so-called &ldquo;real-world needs,&rdquo; as perceived through my little lens on the world (and emails from the whole Percona team telling me when something&rsquo;s wrong). I guess I am likely to remain some kind of benevolent dictator, because I created Maatkit and historically I&rsquo;m the main hacker.

<p>New this month: a bunch of usability and feature enhancements for mk-query-digest, much improved duplicate key checking with mk-duplicate-key-checker, and important bug fixes for mk-parallel-dump and mk-parallel-restore, as well as the usual minor fixes and upgrades.</p>

<p>The full list of changes follows.</p>

        I&rsquo;ve been profiling a Perl program recently with Devel::FastProf, and I had a little bit of a hard time finding one of my hot spots. I had a construct like the following: if ( $condition_one ) { # some code } elsif ( $other_condition ) { # code } elsif ( my (@temp) = $text =~ m/(complex) (regex)/g ) { # some other code } elsif { # and so on }

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 1, 2008</span>
        The December release is here! There are some goodies in this release, but the major one is an initial version of mk-log-parser, a slow log analysis tool that is carefully designed (with lots of input from Percona consultants) to make slow log analysis as productive and easy as possible. It&rsquo;s based on a lot of work Daniel and I have done on log analysis over the years (I actually wrote the initial version a long time ago but never released it).

        Google Code just rocks. It is clean, sparse, elegant, and it has all the functionality I need. Its template-driven issue tracking system (totally flexible and totally easy to flex!), niceties like cross-references between issues and Subversion revisions, simple but completely adequate Wiki, and nice download system are the bomb. And the code reviews and ability to comment on revisions are super nice. Oh, and it&rsquo;s really nice that the data is stored in a place I feel pretty sure is safe.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Nov 6, 2008</span>
        PHP has no built-in debugger.
This is HUGE. The ability to say perl -d .... and have a fully featured, gdb-like debugger at your command, with absolutely nothing to download or install, is HUGE.
Debugging PHP is an epic pain in the best of circumstances, and it&rsquo;s all but impossible on a system you don&rsquo;t control and can&rsquo;t waste a bunch of time on even if you had permission to install things.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Oct 26, 2008</span>
        <p>At my previous employer, one of the early decisions that had huge payoffs later was the SQL naming conventions. A good naming convention is more than just a nicety. It lets you write programs that don&rsquo;t need to be told about the relationships among tables and columns.</p>

<p>There are many ways to do this, I think. But in practice, I think I&rsquo;ve seen only a few customer systems that have a completely consistent, logical naming convention. And there are levels of convenience; some systems have a couple extra rules that make a big difference.</p>

<p>In this post I&rsquo;ll explain the components of my ideal naming conventions.</p>

        <p>Here&rsquo;s a productivity tip that has saved me countless work while typing. Swap your Caps-lock and Escape keys. If you&rsquo;re like most people, you use Caps-lock virtually never, and Escape quite a lot. Especially if you&rsquo;re a programmer who happens to use <a href="http://www.vim.org/">the best text editor, Vim</a>. Read on to learn how to do this.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve created a set of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/">Cacti templates for graphing stats about MySQL</a>. While these were based on several other people&rsquo;s work, there are many improvements. One of them in particular I want to bring up, and I&rsquo;ll go so far as to say it ought to be a &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; for graphing. That is, don&rsquo;t mix units on a graph.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://vividcortex.com/">VividCortex</a> is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what

other features.</p>

        It&rsquo;s been a while since I have updated my JavaScript formatting and parsing functions, and people have been posting comments on them. Unfortunately my interests have really turned elsewhere, and I&rsquo;m not much in the world of frontend web design anymore. There&rsquo;s good news though: now I&rsquo;ve made it easy for you to get the code, change the code, document it, report issues on it, and so forth. I&rsquo;ve hosted the code at Google Code.

        <p>There&rsquo;s a new release with a lot of goodies &ndash; speed, efficiency, user-friendliness, and new features. In particular some of <a href="http://www.percona.com/">Percona&rsquo;s</a> clients have sponsored features for things they need such as the ability to more frequently verify that replicas are in sync with their masters. If you need features, please ask Percona about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://hackmysql.com/">Daniel Nichter</a> has written most of the code for this release. Having a dedicated developer is really moving the project forward. Thanks Daniel!</p>

<p>If you check the issues list on the project&rsquo;s website you&rsquo;ll see we have some ambitious plans for the project, mostly driven by real-world needs from Percona&rsquo;s clients, many of whom run very large data centers and such. It makes me really happy that Maatkit is solving serious problems for which no other solution exists.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the changelog:</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Aug 19, 2008</span>
        <p>I got some interesting comments on my previous article about <a href="/blog/2008/08/18/how-maatkit-benefits-from-test-driven-development/">unit testing Maatkit</a>, including echoes of my own conversion to the unit-testing religion. One of the objections I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about unit-testing is how it&rsquo;s impossible to test code that talks to a database. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too hard,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s easy to test a module that calculates a square root, but a database? Way too much work!&rdquo;</p>

        <p>Over in <a href="http://www.maatkit.org/">Maatkit</a>-land, <a href="http://hackmysql.com/">Daniel Nichter</a> and I practice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-first programming, AKA test-driven development</a>. That is, we write tests for each new feature or to catch regressions on each bug we fix. And &ndash; this is crucial &ndash; we write the tests <em>before</em> we write the code.* The tests should initially fail, which is a validation that the new code actually works and the tests actually verify this. If we don&rsquo;t first write a failing testcase, then our code lacks a very important guarantee: &ldquo;if you break this code, then the test case will tell you so.&rdquo; (A test that doesn&rsquo;t fail when the code fails isn&rsquo;t worth writing.)</p>

        Have you ever run a command on a Unix-like system and then realized it&rsquo;ll take a really long time, and you want to log out of the computer and leave it running? Or maybe you&rsquo;ve connected over SSH to a remote server and executed a command that will take a while, and you&rsquo;re really worried that your network connection will fail and kill the command.
There are several ways to log out without stopping the command.

        Dear reader, this is a challenge. How&rsquo;s your MySQL prowess? You know about LIMIT: it cuts off the results at the specified number.
mysql&gts; select actor_id from sakila.actor where actor_id % 5 = 0 limit 5; +----------+ | actor_id | +----------+ | 5 | | 10 | | 15 | | 20 | | 25 | +----------+ 5 rows in set (0.00 sec) But that query actually accessed 25 rows. What if I want to say &ldquo;return up to 5 rows, but don&rsquo;t read any more than 20 rows to find them?

        Percona is looking to hire someone to develop Maatkit, among other things.
If I weren&rsquo;t having so much fun being the consulting team lead, I&rsquo;d be doing it myself. (In fact, I&rsquo;m still hacking on it a lot. Got some pretty fun stuff done this weekend.) I don&rsquo;t know what the rest of the world thinks, but I think Maatkit is a damn enjoyable project to work on. Hopefully someone else will have the same kind of mindset and want to get paid for it, unlike poor working-on-the-weekends me.

        Joel Spolsky writes about 12 steps to better code, and elsewhere about how candidates should write code in interviews.
The reverse conditions are true, too. If you&rsquo;re a candidate, you should evaluate the employer against the 12 steps, and you should also see code samples. How else will you know what you&rsquo;re getting into? You really have the right to do this, and you should exercise the right. If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll get stuck in a crap job maintaining crap code.

        In my opinion, every Perl programmer needs at least these two books: the Camel, and the Dog (Perl Best Practices).
The Camel teaches you how to program Perl: the syntax and so on. But the Dog teaches you how to program Perl sanely, by recommending that you use only a subset of Perl&rsquo;s syntax and abilities.
The Camel tells you that there&rsquo;s more than one way to do it, which is supposed to be a strength of Perl.

        I&rsquo;ve decided to start replacing L with GL in acronyms where L supposedly stands for Linux.
I&rsquo;m not a big user of acronyms, because I think they are exclusionist and they obscure, rather than revealing. (This wouldn&rsquo;t matter if I wrote for people who already knew what I meant and agreed with me, but that&rsquo;s a waste of time). However, LAMP is one that I&rsquo;ve probably used a few times, without thinking that it is supposed to stand for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP/Perl/Python.
