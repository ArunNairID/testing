        <span class="post-date">Thu, May 6, 2010</span>
        The May release of Maatkit included a new feature in mk-query-digest. This allows you to process queries in many pieces, write out intermediate results, and then combine the pieces in a separate step. Maybe it&rsquo;s not exactly map-reduce, but it makes a good headline.
The purpose is to enable query analysis across an arbitrarily large group of servers. Process queries on all of them, ship the results to a central place, and then combine them together.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Feb 20, 2010</span>
        Maatkit does more than just MySQL. I&rsquo;ve just committed a new version of mk-query-digest, a powerful log analysis tool, with support for Posgtres logs, in both syslog and stderr format. I&rsquo;m hoping that people will give this a spin in the real world. I have lots of test cases, but that&rsquo;s never enough; I&rsquo;m looking for people to crunch their logs and let me know if anything breaks.
A brief tutorial:

        I&rsquo;ve released version 1.1.6 of the Better Cacti Templates project. This release includes a bunch of bug fixes (but not all of them!) and two new sets of graphs. One set is for disk I/O on GNU/Linux, and the other is a new set of templates for OpenVZ. I&rsquo;m looking for feedback on both of those. This release also has a bunch of code-level features: much better test coverage (hooray!), and a refactored ss_get_by_ssh.

        I&rsquo;ve released version 1.1.5 of my improved Cacti templates for MySQL and other components of a LAMP application. This is a pure bug-fix release. One of the bug fixes prevents spikes in graphs, but requires you to rebuild your RRD files. There are upgrade instructions on the project wiki for this and all releases. Use the project issue tracker to view and report issues, and use the project mailing list to discuss the templates and scripts.

        I&rsquo;ve released version 1.1.4 of my improved Cacti templates. Unlike the prior release, which was solely bug fixes, this one includes new graphs in the MySQL template. Some of the graphs are of data that&rsquo;s exposed in standard MySQL versions, but some of it is available only in Percona&rsquo;s high-performance builds of the MySQL database server. If you don&rsquo;t have a Percona build, those graphs will just contain nothing, but there is no detrimental effect.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Oct 24, 2009</span>
        I&rsquo;ve just released version 1.1.3 of the Cacti templates I wrote for MySQL. This is a bug-fix release only, and affects only ss_get_mysql_stats.php. To upgrade from the previous release, upgrade ss_get_mysql_stats.php. Don&rsquo;t forget to save and restore your configuration options, if any. (Note that there is a feature to help with this: you can keep configuration options in ss_get_mysql_stats.php.cnf to avoid making them in ss_get_mysql_stats.php.)

        Maatkit&rsquo;s mk-loadavg tool is a helpful way to gather information about infrequent conditions on your database server (or any other server, really). We wrote it at Percona to help with those repeated cases of things like &ldquo;every two weeks, my database stops processing queries for 30 seconds, but it&rsquo;s not locked up and during this time there is nothing happening.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s pretty much impossible to catch in action, and these conditions can take months to resolve without the aid of good tools.

This is actually quite simple, but for some reason I always find myself confused about how to do it. I have to reason it out all over again, instead of just remembering how to do it.

We&rsquo;ve released two new tools. These are mk-upgrade and mk-log-player.

        Maatkit version 3519 is ready for download. There are a lot of changes in this release, many of which are incompatible with previous releases. There are also a lot of important new features. Read on for the details.
First, thanks to everyone who contributed to this month&rsquo;s release. A lot of people have jumped into Maatkit and started committing code. I attribute this to deliberately forcing a more open policy with decisions being made on the mailing list, rather than the former policy of &ldquo;Percona pays for development, so they have more say than you do&rdquo; &ndash; a snobby and ill-advised way to treat an open-source project.

        If you code by writing tests that fail, and then fixing the tests by writing the code, then you might find yourself switching to a terminal, running the test, ad nauseum. Part 1 of my tip is to run the test in a loop that takes a single keystroke to trigger:
$ while read line; do clear; perl MyTestScript.t; done This works with any language, not just perl &ndash; just replace the test command with the right one.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Apr 12, 2009</span>
        This is really cool. I just learned this: you can treat a Perl variable just like a filehandle (read, write, etc).
my $buffer = ""; open my $fh, "", \$buffer or die $OS_ERROR; print $fh "hello, world\n";  Now $buffer contains &ldquo;hello, world\n&rdquo;. You can do the same kinds of things when reading from a variable.
I knew you could do it with IO::Scalar, but while refreshing my memory on that, I stumbled upon this &ndash; who needs IO::Scalar anymore?

        I always say that the ultimate MySQL tuning script is an expert human. To that end, I generally try to build tools that help a human be more productive with the raw information from MySQL. One of the things we look at during a performance audit is the MySQL status counters. It&rsquo;s useful to look at a) absolute values and b) several incremental snapshots. I&rsquo;ve written a small shell script called &ldquo;mext&rdquo; that can make this a little easier.

        I want to show you two very expensive SQL idioms that almost everyone uses. These are not query optimization problems &ndash; they are financially expensive patterns of SQL.
These queries don&rsquo;t do what the user thinks they do, and thus they create subtle bugs. And the bugs cause a lot of trouble, and they&rsquo;re hard to track down, and much time is spent on them. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write about this for a while, but a book I read recently brought this topic up again, so I dug this draft out and finished it.

Interesting and significant things to mention this month:
