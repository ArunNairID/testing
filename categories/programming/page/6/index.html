        <span class="post-date">Sun, Jan 8, 2006</span>
        ASP.NET has built-in functionality to store profile information about a user. The DB table schema has several design trade-offs that make it somewhat inflexible for certain uses.
ASP.NET will write a custom class, given the properties you want, such as name and birthdate. It will also take care of hooking the plumbing up in the database (there is a little script to create the profile tables in the database). It then stores and retrieves the data on subsequent requests.

        A company for whom I have done some coding advertises their years of service on their website. Every year after the New Year, someone notices the dates are out of whack, sends around an email and it has to be fixed. It&rsquo;s not quite hard-coded, if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re thinking. It&rsquo;s just that the wrong thing is hard-coded in the website&rsquo;s configuration file, Config.asp:
Const YearsOfService = 31 I&rsquo;ve seen someone update that variable literally every year I&rsquo;ve been involved with the company in question.

        My credit card says it expires &ldquo;06/07&#8243;. What is that? Is it June 2007, or July 2006? You may think I&rsquo;m being silly, but it confuses me. I&rsquo;m not as smart as some people, but if it confuses me, it&rsquo;s gonna confuse some others too.
I recently placed an order online and got the expiration date wrong. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been all that bad if the entry form had mimicked exactly what&rsquo;s on the front of my card, but the online form had a 4-digit year pulldown, followed by a two-digit space for the month &ndash; exactly the opposite order from my card.

        Following up on my earlier post, here are some alternate usage scenarios for the UDF I wrote to avoid openxml in SQL Server 2000.
The most obvious variation is to create different versions to return various data types, such as INTEGER or DATETIME or whatnot. I started to do this, but then realized it&rsquo;s silly. If I duplicate the code for every datatype, what have I accomplished besides duplicating code? The input is VARCHAR, so it&rsquo;s getting implicitly converted at some point no matter what.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Dec 10, 2005</span>
        I have written before about badly commented code, but I&rsquo;ve recently encountered two examples of code that warns someone of something bad, then never tells them what it is. This is a great reason to write comments that say why, not what &ndash; my first rule of thumb when commenting code.
Example: SQL stored procedure The first example of a bad comment is in a SQL stored procedure, where a table is updated from a view:

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 1, 2005</span>
        Window&rsquo;s XP&rsquo;s integrated ZIP functionality (built into Windows Explorer) is not trustworthy. You should not rely on it to correctly unzip or show the contents of archives. The problem is related to special characters in filenames. If a filename has one of the forbidden characters, Windows XP simply doesn&rsquo;t extract or show the files. A recent example is the 9rules media kit, which 9rules sent me when I was accepted to the network.

        I rarely blog on other people&rsquo;s content, but I can&rsquo;t agree more strongly with this list of essential tools for software engineering:
 There are an endless pile of tools engineers are fond of using in their development process, but there are only four that they really need:

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Nov 17, 2005</span>
        Using a filesystem, such as an external hard drive, across mutiple platforms can sometimes cause annoying behaviors. For example, filenames may be changed to all uppercase or all lowercase, which may cause problems on a system with case-sensitive filenames or vice versa. Here are my suggestions for minimizing conflicts.
Use only letters and numbers, underscores, and dashes Avoid using characters that any system treats as special characters, not just your own.

        VBScript regular expressions are slightly troublesome, though they certainly help turn VBScript into less of a joke when it comes to text processing. The syntax lacks some of the niceties of Perl or .NET regexes, but is complete enough to be very useful. This article shows you how to avoid potentially serious problems, and explains an undocumented feature.
Undocumented and incorrect behavior  The documentation is incomplete. The RegExp object has an undocumented property, Multiline, which affects pattern matching using the .

        Attribute values in XML are usually double-quoted, but single-quotes can be used as well, according to the relevant part of the XML Spec. Here is the production:
[10] AttValue ::= '"' ([^&lt;&"] | Reference)* '"' | "'" ([^&lt;&'] | Reference)* "'" In plain English: an attribute consists of
 a double or single quote any number of the following:  any character but &lt;, &amp; or &ldquo; OR an entity reference  the same character that was used to begin the attribute (double or single quote)  What&rsquo;s most interesting about this to me is that a &lt; is forbidden inside attribute values, but a &gt; is not.

        Comments are one of the most abused programming techniques. I know I&rsquo;m not the first to say this, but it bears repeating. There are hundreds of ways to misuse comments, and very few ways to use them correctly. In this article I&rsquo;ll pick on just one way to misuse them: fustian pontificating.
Albert Einstein said something like &ldquo;things should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler&rdquo; (it&rsquo;s unclear what he actually said, so I&rsquo;m paraphrasing).

        Bitwise arithmetic can be very useful, and not just for C and graphics programmers, but for all types of programming tasks. Those who use it frequently enough become fluent. Here I present a few tips. As I think of more, I will add them here.
Signed versus unsigned Remember numbers can be signed or unsigned. Know the difference, and know the arithmetic for both. For example, when checking to see if a certain bit is set:

        Simpler is often better. The ability to decide quickly between two equivalent solutions is what sets expert programmers apart. It has been demonstrated over and over again that a) there is more than a tenfold difference in productivity between programmers, and b) there is absolutely zero correlation between speed and quality in programming. Choosing the best solution to a problem is an acquired skill that takes time and experience, but it takes something more as well: a certain mental attitude.
