        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 6, 2007</span>
        I don&rsquo;t love everything about Perl, but I love its sense of humor, which I think probably comes from its creators&rsquo; senses of humor. From the Perl function documentation for redo:
 &ldquo;last&rdquo;, &ldquo;next&rdquo;, or &ldquo;redo&rdquo; may appear within a &ldquo;continue&rdquo; block. &ldquo;last&rdquo; and &ldquo;redo&rdquo; will behave as if they had been executed within the main block. So will &ldquo;next&rdquo;, but since it will execute a &ldquo;continue&rdquo; block, it may be more entertaining.

The conference is by invitation only and very limited; we all had to either have something Google&rsquo;s team of judges thought was good enough to present, or our essays had to impress them (I&rsquo;m not bragging about getting in, I&rsquo;m telling you why I thought the conference would be great).

        Brian Aker was a recent guest on the LinuxCast podcast with Don Marti. Brian has some interesting thoughts in this podcast and elsewhere on his blog, on motivations for writing Free and/or Open Source software. Here&rsquo;s why I do it myself.
First an overview of the podcast, for context: the topics were storage engines, distributed version control, and motivation for open-source. (You should listen to it, if you haven&rsquo;t &ndash; it&rsquo;s short and Brian is a great speaker.

        If you are a Perl developer and you only think of perldoc as the command that formats embedded POD (Plain Old Documentation) and lets you read it like a man page, you&rsquo;re missing two huge time-savers this versatile command can give you.
Function documentation Suppose you&rsquo;re programming and you&rsquo;ve forgotten the exact return values of localtime(). What do you do?
 Get out your Camel book, open it to the alphabetical function reference, and hunt for localtime (it&rsquo;s on page 738 and took me 15 seconds to find, but I got lucky and found the right page with only four flips).

        The bash shell has a powerful parameter expansion syntax, but it&rsquo;s complex and hard to remember. I always forget which syntax does what, even though I use it all the time for scripts and one-off jobs. Unfortunately, I find the man page unhelpful as a reference, so I&rsquo;ve made a cheat sheet for myself. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll find it useful too.

If you want the whole story, type man bash into a terminal, and search for the section titled EXPANSION.

        Several years ago I wrote a pure PHP library for manipulating XML documents with the Document Object Model (DOM) in PHP 4, without external libraries such as libxml. This is often useful on shared hosting providers, where you can&rsquo;t get C extensions installed. The library uses PHP4&#8242;s built-in SAX functions, which are enabled by default. Today I&rsquo;m re-releasing this library under the LGPL (EDIT: later re-released under MIT). You can find it here

If you can do this, you can easily raise your productivity and the quality of your work by an order of magnitude. Much more importantly, you can have a lot more fun writing code. Read on to learn how.

Linuxthreads and NPTL are part of glibc, the GNU C Library. The recommended threading library for GNU/Linux is now NPTL, not linuxthreads, even though the linuxthreads web page&rsquo;s excerpt in Google says it&rsquo;s &ldquo;The recommended threads package for Linux, also included in glibc 2.

        I have re-licensed some of my scripts under the LGPL, which means you can use them as part of other non-GPL software.
The scripts in question are:
 JavaScript number formatting JavaScript date/time formatting and parsing JavaScript date/time chooser for HTML documents JavaScript &ldquo;combo box&rdquo; simulation  Why the change? I&rsquo;ve always released my work under the GPL, but now that I&rsquo;m writing and making available smaller scripts that might be used as part of a larger software system, the GPL isn&rsquo;t as appropriate, because of the licensing requirements it places on the rest of the systems with which the scripts may be used.

Slots in Gentoo Gentoo allows installing multiple versions of packages side-by-side in different &ldquo;slots.&rdquo; This avoids dependency problems. For example, it&rsquo;s possible to run programs that require different versions of libraries, because they can all coexist happily (the lack of this feature on Microsoft Windows is known as DLL hell).

        Unit testing can help make code much more flexible by giving an unambigous, yes-or-no answer about whether the code is right. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain an important principle for making unit tests most useful for refactoring: Test the behavior, not the implementation.
This may not seem important at first glance, but consider what happens when the implementation is tested. If the implementation changes, the test suite breaks! That makes correct refactoring impossible.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, May 4, 2006</span>
        My co-worker John taught me a useful technique to let a program choose an optimal wait time when polling a resource. In the post couple of years, I&rsquo;ve used it many times. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain the technique and give some examples of when to use it (and when not to use it!).
The technique Here is pseudo-code for a process that needs to poll a resource:
wait = 128; minWait = 1; maxWait = 32768; didSomething = false; while (true) { didSomething = false; // Do stuff till done do { stuffToDo = pollResource(); if (stuffToDo) { doStuff(stuffToDo); didSomething = true; } } while (stuffToDo); // Decide how long to wait if (didSomething) { wait = max(minWait, wait / 2); } else { wait = min(maxWait, wait * 2); } // Wait sleep(wait); } This code is an infinite loop that polls something, does what needs to be done, then sleeps a varying amount of time.

It piqued my curiosity, so I visited the ReiserFS website to read more about the filesystem.

 The Reiser team believes equal access to source code is a civil right. I agree. I&rsquo;ve been using version 3 for a long time.
