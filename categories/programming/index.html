        <p>What will life be like in the age of smart machines? According to a <a href="http://issuu.com/batteninstitute/docs/smartmachines-120414-issuu">Batten
Institute briefing on Innovation in the Age of Smart
Machines</a>, up
to 66% of the U.S. workforce may lose their jobs to computers in the coming
decades. The report points out, however, that humans will always be needed to
direct the computers. I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>

        <p>This should sound familiar:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the great lies about NoSQL databases is that they&rsquo;re simple. Simplicity
done wrong makes things a lot harder and more complicated to develop and
operate. Programmers and operations staff end up reimplementing (badly) things
the database should do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nobody argued this line of reasoning more vigorously than when trying to defend
relational databases, especially during the darkest years (ca.  2009-2010), when
NoSQL still meant <strong>NO SQL DAMMIT</strong>, all sorts of NoSQL databases were
sprouting, and most of them were massively overhyped.  But as valid as those
arguments against NoSQL&rsquo;s &ldquo;false economy&rdquo; simplicity were and are, the arguments
against relational databases&rsquo; complexity hold true, too.</p>

        Do you use Google&rsquo;s Go language (golang)? Do you use a relational database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL with it? Do you want to learn how to?
Go has a package called database/sql for connecting to relational databases. There&rsquo;s package documentation, but you&rsquo;ll need to read the source code if you really want to understand how to use the package. The documentation doesn&rsquo;t really explain how to use the package, it just explains what it does.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 29, 2014</span>
        <p>I have $10 that says you&rsquo;ve experienced this before: there&rsquo;s a holiday, trade show, or other important event coming up. Management is worried about the risk of an outage during this all-important time, and restricts deployments from the week prior through the end of the event.</p>

<p>What really happens, of course, is that the system in question becomes booby-trapped with extra risk. As a result, problems are more likely, and when there there is even a slight issue, it has the potential to escalate into a major crisis.</p>

<p>Why does this happen? As usual, there&rsquo;s no single root cause, but a variety of problems combine to create a brittle, risky situation.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/11/freeze.png" alt="freeze" /></p>

<h3 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h3>

<p>When managers declare a freeze, they&rsquo;re not being malicious. They&rsquo;re doing something that seems to make sense. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s important to understand the reasoning.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Jul 14, 2014</span>
        The Docker Book is a newly published book from James Turnbull, whose name you will recognize if you&rsquo;re at all familiar with DevOps, Puppet, or Docker itself. It&rsquo;s a nice introduction to what Docker is and how to get started using it. It&rsquo;s like Goldilocks &mdash; not too detailed, not too superficial, just right.
The book starts from the basics, assuming no prior knowledge with Docker, or even most of the core concepts of virtualization, but moves quickly through these topics into installing Docker and getting started with it.

        <p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve come to believe something that I&rsquo;m not sure others will
agree with. I would like to hear your point of view on it.</p>

<p>I posit that some code can become literally unfixable. Programmers can paint
themselves into a corner with the code and it becomes impossible to get out
again.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/06/humpty.jpg" alt="humpty" /></p>

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Jun 2, 2014</span>
        Anomaly detection is all the buzz these days in the &ldquo;#monitoringlove&rdquo; community.
The conversation usually goes something like the following:
 Alerts are spammy and often generate false positives. What you really want to know is when something anomalous is happening. Anomaly detection can replace static thresholds and heuristics. The result will be better accuracy and lower noise.  I&rsquo;m going to give a webinar about the science of statistical anomaly detection on June 17th.

        <p>A while ago I <a href="/blog/2012/04/24/the-mysql-init-script-mess/">wrote</a> about some of the things that can make MySQL unreliable or hard to operate. Some time after that, in a completely unrelated topic, someone made me aware of a set of principles called <a href="http://12factor.net">12-factor</a> that I believe originated from experiences building Heroku.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/05/dodecahedron.jpg" alt="Dodecahedron" /></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s been over a year, and I&rsquo;ve come to increasingly agree with the 12-factor principles. I guess I&rsquo;m extremely late to the party, but making applications behave in 12-factor-compliant ways has solved a lot of problems for me.</p>

<p>This experience has repeatedly reminded me of one of the applications that continues to cause a lot of the kinds of pain that the 12-factor principles have solved for me: MySQL.</p>

I have also taken a lot of notes. For example, Toufic from Metafor Software suggested that the audience look into the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. I am proud of the slide that made its way into my talk as a result:

        If you&rsquo;re interested in Google&rsquo;s Go programming language, perhaps you aren&rsquo;t sure what drivers to use for MySQL. The good news is there are excellent drivers for MySQL.
There are several opensource ones on GitHub and elsewhere, but the driver I recommend is https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/. Why?
 It is pure Go, not a wrapper around a C library, and is liberally licensed. It is high performance. A lot of work has gone into making it avoid allocations and consume minimal CPU.

        <p>Have you heard of <em>sharding</em> a database? Of course you have. Do you know where
the term comes from? Someone asked me this at a cocktail party recently. I gave
it my best shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The earliest I remember was Google engineers using it to describe the
architecture of some things,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That would have been about 2006.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope. Much earlier than that,&rdquo; said my new friend.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/04/ultima.jpg" alt="ultima" /></p>

<p>I pondered. &ldquo;Well, I guess there was the famous LiveJournal architecture
article about MySQL. That was, I dunno, 2003?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The person then told me the following history. I can neither
confirm nor deny it; what do you know about it?</p>

But then I found that Jason Davies already wrote a great article about it. Play with his live demo. I was able to get a false positive through luck in a few keystrokes: add alice, bob, and carol to the filter, then test the filter for candiceaklda.

        I am interested in compiling a list of techniques to generate fake time-series data that looks and behaves realistically. The goal is to make a mock API for developers to work against, without needing bulky sets of real data, which are annoying to deal with, especially as things change and new types of data are needed.
To achieve this, I think several specific things need to be addressed:
 What common classes or categories of time-series data are there?

        I&rsquo;ve been talking to some smart people about deployment. First a little background. One of my colleagues was working on a project that ultimately didn&rsquo;t bear fruit. It was a system for continuous delivery, and involved reacting to git push by building and shipping to production. But it felt as if the problem shouldn&rsquo;t be separated from provisioning, and from setting up a development environment, and so these things got folded in, and the effort became a boil-the-ocean project that had to be set aside.

My favorite thing about Go is that a good Go program looks self-evident and obvious, even when it may be doing things that would be insanely complex in another language.
