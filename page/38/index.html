        Whew! I just finished a marathon of revisions. It&rsquo;s been a while since I posted about our progress, so here&rsquo;s an update for the curious readers.
I just finished revising the last two major chapters that Peter Zaitsev hasn&rsquo;t yet reviewed. Peter has been essentially going through the chapters like a very thorough technical reviewer. He makes corrections, points out where things aren&rsquo;t clear or need examples, and adds more material.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 5, 2008</span>
        Maatkit contains essential command-line utilities for MySQL, such as a table checksum tool and query profiler. It provides missing features such as checking replicas for data consistency, with emphasis on quality and scriptability.
This release contains bug fixes and new features.
Changelog for mk-archiver: 2008-01-05: version 1.0.6 * Made suffixes for time options optional (bug #1858696). Changelog for mk-deadlock-logger: 2008-01-05: version 1.0.8 * Made suffixes for time options optional (bug #1858696).

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 5, 2008</span>
        My posts lately have been mostly progress reports and release notices. That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re in the home stretch on the book, and I don&rsquo;t have much spare time. However, a lot has also been changing with Maatkit, and I wanted to take some time to write about it properly. I&rsquo;ll just write about each tool in no particular order.
Overall I&rsquo;ve been fixing a fair number of bugs, most of which have been in the code for a while.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 27, 2007</span>
        This release contains bug fixes and new features. The biggest new feature, in my opinion, is a new sync algorithm for mk-table-sync. Now you can sync any table with an index more efficiently than previously. This is the return of the speed I promised earlier. (Though I haven&rsquo;t yet benchmarked it; I am very short on time these days. Your benchmarks and other contributions are welcome).
I&rsquo;m finally feeling like the table sync tool is getting in good shape!

        I&rsquo;ve written before about how to figure out which connection is holding the InnoDB locks for which other connections are waiting. In other words, how to figure out who&rsquo;s blocking you from getting work done when you get InnoDB lock timeouts or other InnoDB lock contention. The short and sweet: turn on the InnoDB lock monitor and use innotop to look at the locks held and waited-for.
The InnoDB lock monitor has a few major disadvantages, though:

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Dec 16, 2007</span>
        This release fixes a few bugs, adds minor features, and adds some debugging support to shared code. I&rsquo;m working on the Nibble sync algorithm for mk-table-sync, and someone has found a few more bugs with mk-parallel-dump, but those might take me a while to complete.

        Well, if my perfectionist nature were allowed to run free, and if Peter et al&rsquo;s encyclopedic knowledge were somehow all transferred to paper, the second edition of High Performance MySQL would end up being the perfect encyclopedia of MySQL performance. But as it is, you&rsquo;re apparently going to have to settle for &ldquo;very good.&rdquo; This quote by Sheeri Kritzer Cabral, one of our tech reviewers, really made my day:
I gotta hand it to Peter, Vadim, Arjen, and Baron.

        To cut down on comment spam, I have Bad Behavior enabled on this blog, and there was a minor issue with the version I had, though in general it has been wonderful. My apologies if it blocked you. I didn&rsquo;t get any email from folks saying they were blocked, but it blocked me! Apparently a fairly common complaint. I&rsquo;ve upgraded now and I&rsquo;m not seeing any more issues.
There&rsquo;s a lot of hate mail towards Bad Behavior&rsquo;s author because of this, so I want to try to cancel some of that out: this plugin has saved me many gray hairs.

        Sheeri wrote a post (now a 404 error) referring to Maatkit on Ohloh, which I have never heard of before. I took a look at what Ohloh thinks about Maatkit. It&rsquo;s kind of neat. Beyond just the obvious &ldquo;social website&rdquo; stuff that&rsquo;s all the rage these days, it actually looks at the project&rsquo;s SVN history, analyzes the codebase, and so on.
It also estimates 8 person-years of work have gone into the project, and says that at $55,000/year it would cost $450,702 to write the code as it currently exists, which is kind of funny.

        Thanks again to all the great sponsors for my week of work on the kit!
This is the long-awaited &ldquo;Baron worked on table sync&rdquo; release. Hooray!
I have resolved all of the issues I was facing in getting a release out the door. I now have individual test suites on all the programs in the kit (some of them trivial, some not) as well as a comprehensive unit test suite on the shared code.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 6, 2007</span>
        This is the last day I&rsquo;m taking off work to hack on mk-table-sync, and I thought it was time for (yet another) progress report. Here&rsquo;s what I have done so far:
 All the code, except for a tiny bit of &ldquo;glue&rdquo; and &ldquo;setup&rdquo; code, is in modules. Lots more tests for the modules. A new sync algorithm (I still haven&rsquo;t rewritten the top-down and bottom-up, which are designed for network efficiency more than MySQL efficiency, and are very complicated).

        &hellip; I didn&rsquo;t get two-way sync done, and I didn&rsquo;t get the Nibble algorithm done. That much I expected. But I also didn&rsquo;t get the current work released tonight because I&rsquo;m paranoid about breaking things. I&rsquo;m trying to go through all the tools and write at least a basic test for them to be sure they can do the simplest &ldquo;unit of work&rdquo; (such as mk-find running and printing out that it finds the mysql.

        I don&rsquo;t love everything about Perl, but I love its sense of humor, which I think probably comes from its creators&rsquo; senses of humor. From the Perl function documentation for redo:
 &ldquo;last&rdquo;, &ldquo;next&rdquo;, or &ldquo;redo&rdquo; may appear within a &ldquo;continue&rdquo; block. &ldquo;last&rdquo; and &ldquo;redo&rdquo; will behave as if they had been executed within the main block. So will &ldquo;next&rdquo;, but since it will execute a &ldquo;continue&rdquo; block, it may be more entertaining.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 3, 2007</span>
        Ironically, the Stream algorithm I wrote as the simplest possible syncing algorithm does what the much more efficient algorithm I wrote some time ago can&rsquo;t do: sync a table without a primary key, as long as there are no duplicate rows. In fact, it&rsquo;s so dumb, it will happily sync any table, even if there are no indexes.
The flash of inspiration I had on Friday has turned out to be good insight.

        My initial plans got waylaid! I didn&rsquo;t pull out the checksumming code first, because the code wasn&rsquo;t at all as I remembered it. Instead, I began writing code to handle the more abstract problem of accepting two sets of rows, finding the differences, and doing something with them. I&rsquo;m ending up with a little more complicated system than I thought I would. However, it&rsquo;s also significantly simpler in some ways. Instead of just passing references to subroutines to use as callbacks, I&rsquo;m object-ifying the entire synchronization concept.

        Tomorrow is the first of five days I will spend working on mk-table-sync, the data synchronization tool I developed as part of Maatkit. The first thing I&rsquo;ll do is pull the row-checksumming code out into a module and write a unit test suite for it. I&rsquo;ll probably add the code to the module that does checksums for mk-table-checksum, since it is not all that different.
My mind is not fresh on the code, but I think the next thing after that will be to pull out the code that finds differences in two sets of rows.

        It&rsquo;s been a while since I said anything about the progress on the book. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we are not still working on it, though.
As Peter wrote a while ago, he is basically wearing the hat of a very advanced technical reviewer at this point. We&rsquo;ve finished writing all the chapters from his detailed outlines. He has worked through about half the chapters, and I&rsquo;m continuing to spend my evenings and weekends and holidays (yes, nearly all my free time &ndash; just ask my wife!

        A while ago I asked for people and/or organizations to sponsor development on Maatkit (formerly MySQL Toolkit) so I could take a week off work and improve the Table Sync tool. I asked for $2500 USD, but several companies have graciously offered to cover that and then some.
I&rsquo;m very happy about this, as it will allow me to dedicate a solid week to fixing bugs and adding features. There&rsquo;s a lot of demand for the tools, and there are a dozen or so bug reports unresolved for the table-sync tool, which I personally want to fix as much as anyone.
