        <span class="post-date">Fri, May 7, 2010</span>
        I frequently encounter MySQL servers with intermittent problems that don&rsquo;t happen when I&rsquo;m watching the server. Gathering good diagnostic data when the problem happens is a must. Aspersa includes two utilities to make this easier.
The first is called &lsquo;stalk&rsquo;. It would be called &lsquo;watch&rsquo; but that&rsquo;s already a name of a standard Unix utility. It simply watches for a condition to happen and fires off the second utility.
This second utility does most of the work.

        Ronald asked me if I could present at ODTUG&rsquo;s Kaleidoscope conference, which is only a couple hours from me, but I&rsquo;ll be at the Netways OSDC that week. Matt Yonkovit will be there representing Percona. I wish I could go: I would really like to mingle with more Oracle users and developers, and I think that participation is the key to building relationships between MySQL and Oracle users &ndash; two groups of people who are going to be overlapping more in the future.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, May 6, 2010</span>
        The May release of Maatkit included a new feature in mk-query-digest. This allows you to process queries in many pieces, write out intermediate results, and then combine the pieces in a separate step. Maybe it&rsquo;s not exactly map-reduce, but it makes a good headline.
The purpose is to enable query analysis across an arbitrarily large group of servers. Process queries on all of them, ship the results to a central place, and then combine them together.

        Forecasting Oracle Performance  Forecasting Oracle Performance. By Craig Shallahamer, Apress 2007. Page count: about 250 pages. (Here&rsquo;s a link to the publisher&rsquo;s site). Short version: buy it and read it, but make sure you don&rsquo;t rely on it alone; deepen your knowledge through other sources.
I bought and read this book because I&rsquo;m interested in performance, performance forecasting, and capacity planning. I&rsquo;m not interested in forecasting Oracle performance per se.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 26, 2010</span>
        A lot of systems are relatively easy to make HA (highly available). You just slap them into a well-known HA framework such as Linux-HA and you&rsquo;re done. But databases are different, especially replicated databases, especially replicated MySQL.
The reason has to do with some properties that hold for many systems, but not for most databases. Most systems that you want to make HA are relatively lightweight and interchangeable, with little to zero statefulness, easy to start, easy to stop, don&rsquo;t care a lot about storage (or at least don&rsquo;t write a lot of data; that&rsquo;s usually delegated to the database), and there&rsquo;s little or no harm done if you ruthlessly behead them.

        Some of the utilities we were adding to Maatkit really did not belong there. Yes, this included some of the functionality in the now-retired mk-audit tool. We really learned a lesson about what it&rsquo;s possible to support, design, spec, code, and test in a single tool.
I&rsquo;ve moved those tools to a new project, Aspersa. Some folks are revolting and calling it Asparagus, because apparently that&rsquo;s easier to say. Aspersa is the name of the common garden snail, which turns out to be a fascinating creature.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Apr 21, 2010</span>
        Much has been made of certain limitations of MySQL&rsquo;s query optimizer (&ldquo;planner&rdquo;). Subqueries, lack of sort-merge joins, and so on. This is not MySQL-bashing and no one should be offended. Some people have worked to make things better, and that code is in branches that were intended for future releases. But if that work were available right now, would you trust it?
This question is important because the optimizer is complex and full of compromises and black magic.

        If you&rsquo;re like me, you&rsquo;ve gotten tired of writing endless test cases for parsers that can understand the thousands of variations of text output by SHOW INNODB STATUS. I&rsquo;ve decided to solve this issue once and for all by patching MySQL and InnoDB to output XML, the universal markup format, so tools can understand and manipulate it easily. Here&rsquo;s a sample snippet:

 VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers MySQL performance monitoring and PostgreSQL performance management among many other features.

        I haven&rsquo;t been blogging much about the changes in MySQL for a while. But the MySQL and InnoDB engineers have been doing a ton of work over the last couple years, and now it&rsquo;s seeing the light of day, so it&rsquo;s time to offer words of congratulations and appreciation about that.
I was holding my breath for a big-splash 5.5 GA announcement at last week&rsquo;s conference, but I was wrong.

 When everything doesn&rsquo;t fit onto a computer, you have to be able to migrate data to multiple nodes. You need some sort of scaling solution there&hellip; MapReduce works as a solution when your queries are operating over a lot of data; Google sizes of data. Few companies have Google-sized datasets though. The average sites you see, they&rsquo;re 10-20 gigs of data.

        In an application such as a database server, instrumentation is like sex: it&rsquo;s not enough to know how often things happen. You also care about how long they took, and in many cases you want to know how big they were.
&ldquo;Things&rdquo; are the things you want to optimize. Want to optimize queries? Then you need to know what activities that query causes. Most systems have at least some of this kind of instrumentation.

        To program is human, to instrument is divine. Complex systems that will support a heavy workload will eventually have to be tuned for it. There are two prerequisites for tuning: tunability, and measurability.
Tunability generally means configuration settings. Adding configuration settings is a sign of a humble and wise programmer. It means that the programmer acknowledges &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how this system will be used, what environment it will run in, or even what my code really does.
