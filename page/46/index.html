        <span class="post-date">Fri, Dec 8, 2006</span>
        Daniel Nichter has released version 3.0 of mysqlreport, one of my favorite tools for quickly comprehending the overall state of a MySQL server. The new version prints out the most important information about InnoDB.
It looks like this:
$ perl mysqlreport --innodb-only MySQL 5.0.26-standard-l uptime 3 9:57:51 Fri Dec 8 17:29:07 2006 __ InnoDB Buffer Pool __________________________________________________ Usage 1.25G of 1.25G %Used: 100.00 Read ratio 0.002 Pages Free 1 %Total: 0.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 7, 2006</span>
        Here are some common SQL problems, all of which have related solutions: how do I find the most recent log entry for each program? How do I find the most popular item from each category? How do I find the top score for each player? In general, these types of &ldquo;select the extreme from each group&rdquo; queries can be solved with the same techniques. I&rsquo;ll explain how to do that in this article, including the harder problem of selecting the top N entries, not just the top 1.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Dec 2, 2006</span>
        I wrote before about a generic, cross-platform way to simulate the SQL ROW_NUMBER() function in any RDBMS. There is a much more efficient way to do this on MySQL with user variables.
Background Please see my previous article on how to simulate the ROW_NUMBER() function for the background. I&rsquo;ll use the same table structure and data in this article.
Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s a quadratic algorithm, so it&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;d do much (though I once did it over small sets of data in SQL Server 2000 at a jobsite).

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Nov 29, 2006</span>
        I wrote a while ago about a program I wrote to export GnuCash data into a MySQL database, including a couple of queries against the resulting schema. I&rsquo;ve made some improvements since then to allow a simple overlay of my wife&rsquo;s categories onto the GnuCash hierarchy. This article explains the improved schema, and includes some more useful tools and queries.
The improved schema The heart of the schema that holds the GnuCash data remains the same, but I&rsquo;ve added a table to overlay our categorization system onto it.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Nov 28, 2006</span>
        Here&rsquo;s a way to write join clauses so they are more compact, more readable, and less confusing.
Standard SQL:2003 defines a USING clause that can serve the same function as the ON clause in the familiar JOIN syntax. For example, the following join
select a.col1, b.col2 from a inner join b on a.col3 = b.col3 May be written as follows:
select a.col1, b.col2 from a inner join b using(col3) That may not look like much of an improvement, but it is a big help in larger joins where many tables have columns with the same names.

        A kind soul has contributed a Debian/Ubuntu package for the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor. Thanks Sebastien Estienne!
Sebastien wrote me that he tested it on Ubuntu Dapper Drake, and I just verified that it works on Edgy Eft.
Since I use Ubuntu on my own machine now, I may integrate this into my build process for future releases of innotop. But for right now, at least there&rsquo;s another installation option.

        Some people who know I&rsquo;ve used Gentoo asked me my thoughts on using it for MySQL servers. Here are my opinions and experiences while using Gentoo, both for desktop systems and for servers.
This is long, but hopefully the brain dump is useful to you. I have so many thoughts on this subject that I&rsquo;m having a hard time really organizing them well, and I&rsquo;m censoring myself too because I know I represent only a very small, focused viewpoint on Gentoo.

The event The event brought together the MySQL community in a distinctly un-conference setting, to gather in groups to discuss or hack on something, rather than sitting in chairs with donuts and coffee listening to someone show Powerpoint slides branded with corporate logos.

        I recently tested innotop on Microsoft Windows. There was one slight glitch, but I changed a couple lines of code, and now it runs out of the box under ActivePerl. Version 0.1.156 contains those changes for Windows compatibility.
How to install I installed it under ActivePerl 5.8.8 build 819:
 Download and install ActivePerl After installation, open the Perl Package Manager from Start/Programs/ActivePerl 5.8.8 Build 819. Select Time-HiRes, DBD-mysql, and install them.

FreeBSD adds innotop to ports When this is finalized, FreeBSD users will be able to install innotop with the following commands:
cd /usr/ports/databases/innotop make all install This is great news. It makes innotop easier to find, install and use.

        Several years ago I wrote a pure PHP library for manipulating XML documents with the Document Object Model (DOM) in PHP 4, without external libraries such as libxml. This is often useful on shared hosting providers, where you can&rsquo;t get C extensions installed. The library uses PHP4&#8242;s built-in SAX functions, which are enabled by default. Today I&rsquo;m re-releasing this library under the LGPL (EDIT: later re-released under MIT). You can find it here

Innotop upgrade: new features, stability Now you can easily monitor open tables with innotop. Just get the latest version (your configuration file will be upgraded seamlessly) and press the &lsquo;O&rsquo; key (that&rsquo;s capital &ldquo;oh&rdquo;).

MySQL provides some tools to monitor and troubleshoot a MySQL server, but they don't always suit a MySQL developer or administrator's common needs, or may not work in some scenarios, such as remote or over-the-web monitoring. Fortunately, the MySQL community has created a variety of free tools to fill the gaps. On the other hand, many of these are hard to find via web searches.

        This is the fourth in a series of articles on profiling MySQL. My past three articles have explained how to measure the work a query causes MySQL to do. In this article I introduce a tool I&rsquo;ve written to do the work for you and produce a compact, readable report of that work, with all the math already done, and the measurements labelled and grouped for ease of comprehension. With this tool you can understand query performance at a glance.

        When people discuss query optimization on MySQL, or say a query doesn&rsquo;t perform well, they usually mention execution time. Execution time is important, but it&rsquo;s not the only metric to use (or even the best). There are many other ways to measure the work a query requires. This article explains how to really profile a query &ndash; what to measure, how to do it as accurately as possible, and what it means.
