        <span class="post-date">Fri, Apr 17, 2009</span>
        I&rsquo;m presenting about Maatkit, the toolkit I created to make life better with MySQL, at the MySQL conference next week.
I&rsquo;m going to give you a whirlwind tour through some of Maatkit&rsquo;s features and functionality. The toolkit is much too large and complex to cover more than a small part of it in depth. So here is your advance warning: I&rsquo;m going to go through a lot of material, and I won&rsquo;t be stopping for lengthy discussions :-) The Maatkit documentation is very thorough, and I hope to introduce you to things that could be of use to you, so you can go learn about those topics from the documentation.

        It&rsquo;s a feature preview with many limitations, but this is still good news. This has been a pretty severe performance limitation for replication in MySQL, which has prompted many a workaround.
Interestingly, the feature preview is based on MySQL 5.1, which has recently seemed to be getting some significant changes even though it&rsquo;s a GA release. Does this signal a change to MySQL&rsquo;s release cycle, which has sometimes been characterized as too long?

        Having written about what I think is cool about the upcoming MySQL Conference and the MySQL Camp, now I want to finish up with what I&rsquo;d like to see at the Percona Performance Conference. Just to recap, this is a conference we created to serve those who want to learn about performance &ndash; not &ldquo;learn about MySQL,&rdquo; not &ldquo;learn about database performance,&rdquo; just learn about performance, period.
I want to see everything.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Apr 14, 2009</span>
        I wrote previously about what I&rsquo;m looking forward to at the upcoming MySQL Conference (next week!). Now I want to write about the free, community-organized unconference being held concurrently, MySQL Camp 2009.
It runs from Sunday through Thursday of next week, which is even longer than the MySQL conference. It starts Sunday with a day of games, then there are really good sessions throughout the week. In fact, I daresay the schedule is at times more interesting than the main MySQL conference:

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Apr 12, 2009</span>
        This is really cool. I just learned this: you can treat a Perl variable just like a filehandle (read, write, etc).
my $buffer = ""; open my $fh, "", \$buffer or die $OS_ERROR; print $fh "hello, world\n";  Now $buffer contains &ldquo;hello, world\n&rdquo;. You can do the same kinds of things when reading from a variable.
I knew you could do it with IO::Scalar, but while refreshing my memory on that, I stumbled upon this &ndash; who needs IO::Scalar anymore?

        I always say that the ultimate MySQL tuning script is an expert human. To that end, I generally try to build tools that help a human be more productive with the raw information from MySQL. One of the things we look at during a performance audit is the MySQL status counters. It&rsquo;s useful to look at a) absolute values and b) several incremental snapshots. I&rsquo;ve written a small shell script called &ldquo;mext&rdquo; that can make this a little easier.

        I haven&rsquo;t really decided my schedule yet during the conference, but I thought I&rsquo;d mention these sessions that look interesting to me.
I&rsquo;m presenting a session on how to use Maatkit, which I think attendees will get a lot of benefit from.

        Some unsettling things happened in MySQL in the past week or so.
New storage engine not mentioned in the changelog There&rsquo;s a bit of a storm brewing over at the MySQL Performance Blog, where Vadim reports discovering a new storage engine added without mention in the 5.1.33 changelog. This is in defiance of the policy of not making changes in a production release. And it certainly belongs in the changelog &ndash; but there is no sign that anyone will remedy this problem.

        I want to show you two very expensive SQL idioms that almost everyone uses. These are not query optimization problems &ndash; they are financially expensive patterns of SQL.
These queries don&rsquo;t do what the user thinks they do, and thus they create subtle bugs. And the bugs cause a lot of trouble, and they&rsquo;re hard to track down, and much time is spent on them. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write about this for a while, but a book I read recently brought this topic up again, so I dug this draft out and finished it.

        I missed Friday and part of Saturday, but I was at PostgreSQL Conference East 2009 for part of Saturday (and will be for part of Sunday too.) A brief recap of the talks I attended:
 PostgreSQL Backup and Recovery &ndash; by Kevin Kempter of Consistent State. I arrived halfway through, and heard about PITR, Slony, and a few other topics. Playing with Playr &ndash; by Jonah Harris of myYearbook. Playr is a tool that analyzes log files, and lets you replay them exactly (same timing, same commit order, same concurrency, etc).

        WARNING: nearly every word of this post is intentionally false. This is an April Fool's joke. There is so much misinformation out there about how MySQL works. If you&rsquo;ve talked to someone from PostgreSQL, you&rsquo;ve surely heard some of it: &ldquo;MySQL doesn&rsquo;t even have transactions,&rdquo; for example. And this from a PostgreSQL user, who uses a database that doesn&rsquo;t even run on Windows.
But even within the ranks of people who supposedly know MySQL&rsquo;s workings, lots of people just get things dead wrong.

        I really like Dokuwiki. I remember looking at it many years ago (even then, there were way too many wikis) but for some reason my company or project at the time didn&rsquo;t choose it. Maybe this was the company that decided Sharepoint was better, I don&rsquo;t remember. (They never did understand why a collection of Word documents was inferior to a wiki.)
I&rsquo;ve been using it for a while now, and of all the wikis I&rsquo;ve used, which are quite a few, it is easily the nicest.

Just set your pager to md5sum:

I think Josh Berkus has talked me into doing some kind of lightning talk on what the PostgreSQL community is doing right from my POV, and what parts of that I try to emulate in &ldquo;other&rdquo; areas of my professional life (if you know what I mean), though I can&rsquo;t see how that can actually fit into a lightning talk.

 The Drizzle list is talking about test coverage and completeness, and schedulers. The MySQL internals list has recently been dominated with talk about coding standards. The PostgreSQL hackers list is talking about a ton of stuff. I don&rsquo;t even try to keep up. The Percona launchpad list is talking about bugs, xtrabackup, and more bugs and patches for them.

        Suppose you have a MySQL master-slave replication setup. It is very straightforward, nothing exotic at all. Imagine that it is the simplest possible setup. Everything is fine, there is nothing wrong or misconfigured with either server.
Now you add another replica, and replication on your existing replica fails. You did not change anything on your existing replica or master. How did this happen?

Most of these are &ldquo;gotchas&rdquo; that would be contraindications or require some thought about a workaround.
Note: this is not meant to be MySQL-bashing.
