        <span class="post-date">Tue, Sep 29, 2015</span>
        I don&rsquo;t give personal, one-to-one technical support for open source software I&rsquo;ve created, nor do I help people with SQL or other questions. The reasons are not obvious to many people, and this blog is meant to document them.
What do I mean by personal tech support? I mean I don&rsquo;t use private email or other means to answer questions about software I&rsquo;ve created. I don&rsquo;t troubleshoot bugs or answer how-to questions individually.

        <p>A number of people have commented to me over the last few years that when they
search for me on Google, it suggests that they might want to search for &ldquo;Baron
Schwartz left Percona.&rdquo; This is a top suggestion when I search for myself, too.</p>

<p>Since people are searching for it, maybe I should explain it.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Aug 8, 2015</span>
        <p>Years ago I pursued my interest in InnoDB&rsquo;s architecture and design, and became impressed with its sophistication. Another way to say it is that <a href="/blog/2014/12/08/eventual-consistency-simpler-than-mvcc/">InnoDB is complicated, as are all MVCC databases</a>. However, InnoDB manages to hide the bulk of its complexity entirely from most users.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2015/08/iceberg.jpg" alt="Iceberg" /></p>

<p>I decided to at least outline a book on InnoDB. After researching it for a while, it became clear that it would need to be a series of books in multiple volumes, with somewhere between 1000 and 2000 pages total.</p>

<p>At one time I actually understood a lot of this material, but I have forgotten most of it now.</p>

<p>I did not begin writing. Although it is incomplete, outdated, and in some cases wrong, I share the outline here in case anyone is interested. It might be of particular interest to someone who thinks it&rsquo;s an easy task to write a new database.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jul 21, 2015</span>
        <p>Database performance optimization is usually a topic concerned with indexes, SQL
design, lock contention, and the like. But the real database bottleneck is the
siloed culture that accretes around the database and has secondary and tertiary
effects that are far more pernicious than you might think. The real opportunity
in database optimization is the interplay between the technology and the
organization, and its communication structures.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Jun 7, 2015</span>
        <p>In my <a href="/blog/2015/06/05/maximize-productivity-in-three-easy-steps/">last blog post</a> I explained how to reclaim your mornings and make them the most productive time of day.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Jun 5, 2015</span>
        <p>If you&rsquo;re like a lot of knowledge workers, you might feel that you spend your
time unproductively. You seem to &ldquo;do stuff&rdquo; all day long but then
feel that you&rsquo;ve done nothing but &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; at the end of the day.</p>

<p>How can you change this? I&rsquo;ve found three things that work for me to not only
stay focused and achieve my objectives, but also help me feel better about
myself. You see, although on a less <a href="/blog/2014/07/05/on-focus/">focused</a> day I
might not <em>feel</em> very productive, it&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;ve failed to achieve anything
(though I might have achieved fewer of my most valuable goals). It&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;ve
worked with an unclear mind, and later cannot remember exactly what I did during
the day. This leads directly to self-doubt and self-criticism.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2015/06/sky.jpg" alt="Sky" /></p>

<p>Solving this problem is fairly simple for me and results in terrific
productivity, as well as a great sense of satisfaction and progress at the end
of the day.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Mon, May 25, 2015</span>
        <p>Many database vendors would like me to take a look at their products and
consider adopting them for all sorts of purposes. Often they&rsquo;re pitching
something quite new and unproven as a replacement for mature, boring technology
I&rsquo;m using happily.</p>

<p>I would consider a new and unproven technology, and I often have. As I&rsquo;ve
written previously, though, <a href="/blog/2014/06/08/time-series-database-requirements/">a real evaluation takes a lot of
effort</a>, and that
makes most evaluations non-starters.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important thing I&rsquo;m considering is whether the product is
mature. There are different levels of maturity, naturally, but I want to
understand whether it&rsquo;s mature enough for me to take a look at it. And in that
spirit, it&rsquo;s worth understanding what makes a database mature.</p>

MongoDB isn&rsquo;t able to fix all the problems alone, and an ecosystem is growing.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve written a few times before about how to write a good conference proposal.
I&rsquo;ve been on the committee of various conferences many times. It&rsquo;s surprising
how few people actually can write good proposals. Somehow it&rsquo;s also suprisingly
hard to explain what makes a good one, so I&rsquo;m going to give this another try.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Apr 5, 2015</span>
        <p>Everyone who&rsquo;s been successful at creating something remarkable, and scaling it,
likely has developed into a repeatable process. If they hadn&rsquo;t, they wouldn&rsquo;t
have scaled it, and you&rsquo;d never have heard of it. (There are lots of geniuses
you&rsquo;ve never heard of who&rsquo;ve created remarkable results at an individual level.)</p>

<p>A lot of times they&rsquo;ll go through several iterations of massive success with
this, then write some books, found a consulting company, go on the speaking
circuit, and so on. And almost always, they seem to demand rigid adherence to
specific sacred-cow principles that must remain inviolate.</p>

<p>You should be really skeptical of anything that smells like this. Sacred cows
make the best steaks, and here&rsquo;s why.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Apr 4, 2015</span>
        <p>Everyone loves (or
<a href="http://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/switched-standing-desk-now">mocks</a>)
a good standing desk, but most of us don&rsquo;t love the price.
Adjustable sit/stand desks and bolt-on apparatus I&rsquo;ve seen cost up to $1000 to
$5000. I have a feeling if you get something on the cheap end of that scale, you
probably will regret it. There are less expensive ones that just sit on your
desk, but they seem like abominations I would hate to use.</p>

<p>As an alternative I won&rsquo;t regret because it&rsquo;s cheap and minimalistic, I&rsquo;ve
been using a simple but effective
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004QXIFCC/?tag=xaprb-20">adjustable laptop holder</a>
for a few years. It&rsquo;s easy to place on a desktop or counter. At this point there
are a few of them at work and one at home. I keep recommending them to friends
so I might as well just post it here too.</p>

        <p>I used Google Reader since time out of mind, but of course by now you know it
was discontinued a while ago. I still live and breathe RSS feeds, and I really
don&rsquo;t pay much attention to social media, news sites, or the like of Hacker News
and Slashdot. I like the flexibility and unhurried pace of subscribing to
updates from specific individuals and companies.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2015/04/grapes.jpg" alt="Grapes" /></p>

<p>At first, I didn&rsquo;t see a reader that offered the experience I was looking for: a
GMail-like user interface with feeds clustered together in categories, navigable
with keystrokes. Importantly, some subtle features such as marking an item
unread are a key part of my usage.</p>

Institute briefing on Innovation in the Age of Smart
Machines</a>, up
to 66% of the U.S. workforce may lose their jobs to computers in the coming
decades. The report points out, however, that humans will always be needed to
direct the computers. I&rsquo;m not so sure.</p>

<p>I recently updated the <a href="http://www.highperfmysql.com">High Performance MySQL</a>
website to modernize it. I am impressed at how easy it is these days to get a
great little brochure site hosted. It used to be a lot more work. I used a
variety of tools and services to do this and decided to share this for people
who are interested. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll add comments and point me towards more
tools and tips to make these things even easier for me in the future!</p>

<p>DevOps is everywhere! The growth and mindshare of the movement is remarkable. But if you care deeply about DevOps, you might agree with me when I say that although its moment has “arrived,” DevOps is in serious trouble. The movement is fragmented and weakly defined, and is being usurped by those who care more about short-term opportunities than the long-term viability of DevOps.</p>
