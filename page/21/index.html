        <span class="post-date">Wed, Jun 30, 2010</span>
        I use a super-simple system for keeping track of tasks that are mine personally to manage. I use issue-tracking systems for software projects and consulting work, but there is still a bunch of work-related and personal work that I need to make sure I don&rsquo;t forget.
The main point is not to ensure that I don&rsquo;t forget, actually. It is to be able to put it out of my mind with confidence that I won&rsquo;t lose it.

        In addition to the Boston edition, there&rsquo;s an OpenSQL Camp at the same time and place as FrOSCon mid-August in Germany. The call for papers is open until July 11th. As always, the conference is about all kinds of open-source databases: MySQL and PostgreSQL are only two of the obvious ones; MongoDB and Cassandra featured prominently at the last one I attended, and SQLite was well represented at the first one.

        Sheeri and others are organizing another incarnation of OpenSQL Camp in October in Boston. You ought to go! It&rsquo;s relevant to MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and lots of the newer generation of databases &ndash; MongoDB, Cassandra, and so on.

        The Maatkit toolkit for MySQL has a lot of functionality that&rsquo;s common across the tools. It&rsquo;s not a good idea to document this in each tool&rsquo;s man page, of course. So there is an overall maatkit man page. It explains concepts such as configuration file syntax. This and all the other Maatkit man pages are online.

        Dr. Richard Hipp gave a talk at Southeast Linux Fest today on choosing an open-source database. He thinks that NoSQL is not a very good name for the new databases we&rsquo;re seeing these days, so he proposed a new name: postmodern databases. Why postmodern?
 The absence of objective truth Queries return opinions, not facts  I thought this was the best proposal I&rsquo;ve heard for an alternative to the NoSQL moniker.

There&rsquo;s a list of illustrious speakers including several well-known in the database world: Joshua Drake and Andrew Dunstan (PostgreSQL), D. Richard Hipp (SQLite), and yes, yours truly (MySQL), plus a MySQL name that&rsquo;s new to me: Brandon Checketts. There are a ton of non-database sessions too! Check out the full speaker &#038; session list. This was a great show last year; I highly encourage everyone to attend.

        I wrote recently about early detection for MySQL performance problems. If your server is having micro-fluctuations in performance, it&rsquo;s important to know, because very soon they will turn much worse. What can you do about this?
The most important thing is not to guess at what&rsquo;s happening, but to measure instead. I have seen these problems from DNS, the binary log, failing hardware, the query cache, the table cache, the thread cache, and a variety of InnoDB edge cases.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, May 25, 2010</span>
        The traditional way to build Cacti templates is through the Cacti web interface. This is an enormous amount of work, and the result is generally not very consistent or good quality. The process is too error-prone. You can export the templates as XML, but they tend to have problems such as version incompatibilities with other Cacti installations, and it&rsquo;s hard to adapt them for user preferences such as different graph image sizes and polling intervals.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, May 25, 2010</span>
        <p>One of the things that makes a traditional transactional database hard to make highly available is a relatively slow shutdown and start-up time. Applications typically delegate most or all writes to the database, which tends to run with a lot of &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; data in its (often large) memory. At shutdown time, the dirty memory needs to be written to disk, so the recovery routine doesn&rsquo;t have to run at startup. And even upon a clean startup, the database probably has to warm up, which can also take a very long time.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2010/05/ligatures.jpg" alt="Ligatures" /></p>

<p>Some databases let the operating system handle most of their memory management needs. This has its own challenges, especially if the <a href="http://blog.2ndquadrant.com/en/2010/05/postgresql-freebsd-and-free-do.html">operating system&rsquo;s design doesn&rsquo;t align exactly with the database&rsquo;s goals</a>.</p>

There are a dozen contributors, including some of my favorites such as Theo Schlossnagle, whose Scalable Internet Architectures is on my (quite short) list of essential books.

        I spent a little time yesterday doing some things with the &ldquo;summary&rdquo; tool from Aspersa. I added support for summarizing status and configuration of Adaptec and LSI MegaRAID controllers. I also figured out how to write a test suite for Bash scripts, so most major parts of the tool are fully tested now. I learned a lot more sed and awk this weekend.
There is really only one way to get status of Adaptec controllers (/usr/StorMan/arcconf), but the LSI controllers can be queried through multiple tools.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, May 14, 2010</span>
        These days I spend more time looking at /proc/diskstats than I do at iostat. The problem with iostat is that it lumps reads and writes together, and I want to see them separately. That&rsquo;s really important on a database server (e.g. MySQL performance analysis).
It&rsquo;s not easy to read /proc/diskstats by looking at them, though. So I usually do the following to get a nice readable table:

        I like to write tools that make hard things easy, when possible. By and large, MySQL is easy and simple. But some simple things are too hard with MySQL. I want to change that, at least for the things that matter the most to me, and which I think I know how to fix.
I will probably write a lot about this. I have already written a number of rants blog posts about the lack of instrumentation in MySQL, and that is where I&rsquo;ll probably continue to put most of my energy.

        Most database companies would be proud to say that their products perform optimally out of the box. It means they accomplished a Herculean feat of engineering. But most databases have configuration options because this is almost impossible. For example, MySQL has scores of tuning options, and it needs a lot more.
So when someone benchmarks your database and makes you look bad, usually you can say &ldquo;that benchmark was run by someone who doesn&rsquo;t know how to properly tune my database software.

        I was just reading up on the syntax for index hints in MySQL, and noticed this:
 An index_name value need not be a full index name. It can be an unambiguous prefix of an index name. If a prefix is ambiguous, an error occurs. I actually prefer not to have extra &ldquo;syntactic sugar&rdquo; features such as this. It helps avoid bugs and unexpected behavior. Even if I don&rsquo;t use it intentionally, I can get bitten by it, if someone adds another index whose name has the same prefix as one that I already use:

        In a couple of recent consulting cases, I needed a tool to analyze how a log of queries accesses indexes and tables in the database, specifically, to find out which indexes are not used. I initially hacked together something similar to Daniel Nichter&rsquo;s mysqlidxchk, but using the framework provided by Maatkit, which gave me a pretty good start right out of the box. This was useful in the very tight time constraints I was under, but was not a complete solution.

        A lot of conversations with a few different people I respect (no links, sorry) have coalesced some thoughts about these newly popular &ldquo;non-relational&rdquo; datastores. I wanted to point out an aspect I&rsquo;m not sure is very clear in the hot-topic department. This is about what happens when managers learn that their developers or operations team have installed some new technology in their systems without them knowing it.
Lest anyone think that this happens only in a poorly-managed company, I can attest that it happens everywhere, all the time.

 Such a large sort_buffer_size is a serious problem, but unfortunately there is a lot of cargo cult advice on the Internet, in books, and in &ldquo;tuning scripts,&rdquo; that perpetuates the harmful advice to increase it.
