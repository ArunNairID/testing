        <span class="post-date">Wed, Mar 7, 2012</span>
        Someone asked me yesterday why there are no TPC benchmarks for MySQL. By &ldquo;benchmarks&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t mean &ldquo;benchmark tools&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;official benchmark results.&rdquo; For example, see the current TPC-C benchmarks. Any true TPC benchmark has to be certified by the TPC and is an arduous and expensive process. Is it time for MySQL to play in this theater? Or does it simply not matter?

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Mar 2, 2012</span>
        If you haven&rsquo;t booked your hotel room yet, you should do it ASAP. The hotel is going to raise their rates at the same time the early-bird conference rate expires. This is a coincidence: Percona has no control over hotel prices. (There is a group discount rate, but we don&rsquo;t call the shots on that.)
A good rule of thumb is that if you&rsquo;re thinking about traveling somewhere, you should book your hotel immediately, and cancel if you change your mind.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Mar 2, 2012</span>
        When people ask me about high availability, I often suggest that it&rsquo;s helpful to understand whether you&rsquo;re most interested in service availability, data availability, or both. Of course, you want both &ndash; but if cost is an object, you may end up relaxing your requirements.
The typical example of an application that needs service availability but doesn&rsquo;t have strong data availability requirements is something that&rsquo;s ad-supported. Who cares if the last few comments on funny cat photos are lost?

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Feb 28, 2012</span>
        MySQL 5.6 is going to have a lot of improvements. I want to mention a few things I think are uniquely valuable for a large set of typical MySQL users.
The first is index condition pushdown. If you&rsquo;ve read High Performance MySQL, you saw a lengthy &ldquo;indexing case study&rdquo; in the chapter on indexing. It&rsquo;s many pages of if-this-then-that kinds of things: you have to include this column in the index, but then in that order, but only for this query because for this other query you need these other indexes with columns in these orders, and this index can be suitable for these queries if you combine some other things, and it just goes on and on.

        This is a cross-post from the MySQL Performance Blog. I thought it would be interesting to users of PostgreSQL, Redis, Memcached, and $system-of-interest as well.
 VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production. It does TCP network traffic analysis. VividCortex offers MySQL performance monitoring and PostgreSQL performance management among many other features.
 For about the past year I&rsquo;ve been formulating a series of tools and practices that can provide deep insight into system performance simply by looking at TCP packet headers, and when they arrive and depart from a system.

        The Northern California Oracle Users Group (NoCOUG) just published an interview with me in their journal. It&rsquo;s titled &ldquo;A Whole New World of MySQL&rdquo;. You can read it in the full journal (PDF), or on Iggy Fernandez&rsquo;s blog. The full journal is well worth a read; there&rsquo;s a lot of good information.
Thanks to Iggy for such a thought-provoking interview, and for inviting me to participate!

        O&rsquo;Reilly isn&rsquo;t the only excellent tech publisher, but they&rsquo;re the one whose books most consistently give me pleasure to read. After going through the process of writing two books with them, one of the things that&rsquo;s struck me is how much they invest into the thankless tasks such as indexing, proofreading, and copyediting their authors&rsquo; work.
There are probably many steps in the production process &ndash; what happens after the author &ldquo;finishes&rdquo; the book &ndash; that I know nothing about.

        After the recent update to pt-table-checksum, I&rsquo;ve seen a few FAQs about it.
Q: is it still multi-threaded/parallel? A: No, that was a pile of bugs and complexity. If you need to run the tool in parallel to take advantage of powerful hardware, you can run several instances, say, one per database.
Q: what chunk size should I use? A: None, let the tool adjust itself dynamically.
Q: what if it skips a table or chunk because it&rsquo;s oversized?

In any case, I&rsquo;ll be giving some tutorials again this year, and two of my talks have been accepted: Measuring Scalability and Performance With TCP and Diagnosing intermittent performance problems.
This seems like an appropriate place to mention a few words about the conference organization.

        Schooner has a blog post showing that one node of their product beats 9 nodes of Clustrix&rsquo;s in throughput. But this reduces everything to a single number, and that&rsquo;s not everything that matters. If you&rsquo;ve looked at Vadim&rsquo;s white paper about Clustrix&rsquo;s (paid-for) performance evaluation with Percona, you see there is a lot of detail about how consistent the throughput and response time are.
I&rsquo;d love to see that level of details in any product comparison.

So, with the generous help of our meeting host Meddius, we&rsquo;re going to do it regularly on the 3rd Wednesday of every month. The next event is already scheduled &ndash; I will be talking about high availability options for MySQL.

If you&rsquo;re not familiar with this topic, it&rsquo;s one of those must-do things that no one officially tells you is necessary with MySQL. The new tools in Percona Toolkit 2.0.3 make it much easier and less complicated &ndash; and safer &ndash; than before. Well worth an hour of your time.

        If you&rsquo;re in the DC area, there&rsquo;s an emergency meeting of the DC Tech Meetup to get involved in advocating against SOPA and PIPA legislation.
If you can&rsquo;t make it in person, you can use the EFF&rsquo;s online form to write your representatives about SOPA and PIPA.
Don&rsquo;t wait until it&rsquo;s too late. The Internet is a vital part of our freedom. Well-intentioned legislators could damage that greatly while trying to solve problems they don&rsquo;t understand fully.

Eric Bergen called the second edition &ldquo;the best MySQL book on the planet&rdquo;. What will the third edition be called? The best in the solar system?

        As a MySQL consultant, I spend a lot of time talking with people about their backups. More specifically, we talk a lot about recovery. I had an interesting incident myself, which illustrates some of the things that are bound to happen as time passes.
First, let me explain how I do my personal backups. I have a series of external hard drives, which are fully encrypted, as is my computer&rsquo;s hard drive.
