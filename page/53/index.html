        <span class="post-date">Tue, Dec 20, 2005</span>
        If you have questions or comments or bugs report, or a change to make, be sure to use the project's new homepage: Flexible JS Formatting Libraries In this post I&rsquo;ll explain how I built on my runtime date-formatting functionality into the date-parsing realm. The result is a date-parsing library that literally creates itself at runtime.
The demo I have a demo of the date-parsing library online for your enjoyment.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 15, 2005</span>
        One of CSS&rsquo;s loftiest goals was to help separate content and presentation on the Web1. It has succeeded to some degree, bringing great benefits in terms of maintainability, usability, and accessibility.
Think at a higher level There is much noise about content and presentation, but it&rsquo;s not the only beneficial separation. In fact, pick any dimensions you wish, and I think you can benefit by distinguishing among them at least to some degree: content, presentation, structure, behavior, and so forth.

        Following up on my earlier post, here are some alternate usage scenarios for the UDF I wrote to avoid openxml in SQL Server 2000.
The most obvious variation is to create different versions to return various data types, such as INTEGER or DATETIME or whatnot. I started to do this, but then realized it&rsquo;s silly. If I duplicate the code for every datatype, what have I accomplished besides duplicating code? The input is VARCHAR, so it&rsquo;s getting implicitly converted at some point no matter what.

        Just a quick note on the newness of Web 2.0 and how little weight you should assign to the many opinions floating around, including mine. The web has exploded in the last few years. A lot of people are making a lot of great things. There are also many self-proclaimed pundits and people proclaiming others to be pundits. Whether labeled as pundits by themselves or others, these people aren&rsquo;t infallible; they don&rsquo;t know things for certain.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 12, 2005</span>
        Have you ever written JavaScript code whose behavior is undefined until runtime, is inefficient, and could be written efficiently if you knew the behavior ahead of time? Here&rsquo;s a way to overcome this: defer it all till runtime, then dynamically build a more efficient function once you know what it has to do. In this article I&rsquo;ll use date formatting as an example of how to take a performance hit once on the first invocation, and get extremely fast performance thereafter.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Dec 11, 2005</span>
        This article explains how to write WHERE clauses that accept optional parameters, reducing the need for separate queries. I have seen a lot of SQL code where the SELECT is duplicated many times, but the WHERE clause is different in each one, and only one will execute. It&rsquo;s easy to factor out the differences in the WHERE clause. For example, consider the following code, assuming two optional parameters to the query:

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Dec 10, 2005</span>
        I have written before about badly commented code, but I&rsquo;ve recently encountered two examples of code that warns someone of something bad, then never tells them what it is. This is a great reason to write comments that say why, not what &ndash; my first rule of thumb when commenting code.
Example: SQL stored procedure The first example of a bad comment is in a SQL stored procedure, where a table is updated from a view:

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 8, 2005</span>
        My current employer has created a policy for documenting database tables. When tables are created or modified, we are required to add extended properties to the tables and columns. SQL Server 2000&#8242;s extended properties are name/value pairs, which can be attached to most objects. There are a few different ways to view them:
 as the &ldquo;Description&rdquo; field in the &ldquo;Design Table&rdquo; dialog in Visual Studio by right-clicking on an object in the Object Browser in Query Analyzer with system stored procedures and built-in functions such as fn_listextendedproperty  None of these is convenient or safe when browsing around the databases.

        For the sake of adding cross-references and my own analysis, I&rsquo;m going to replicate part of someone else&rsquo;s idea. An integers table can be used to create any desired sequence of numbers, and the idea can be extended to other data types as well. It&rsquo;s easy to use a mutex table as an integers table, so there&rsquo;s no need for two tables of the values. You can even create tables with characters, use integers with date functions to generate a range of dates, and so forth.

        Sometimes it is important to know which values in a sequence are missing, either to find unused values so they can be used, or to find &ldquo;holes&rdquo; in the data. In this article I&rsquo;ll show you how to find missing values, how to find the start and end of ranges of missing values, and how to optimize the queries for best performance.
Exclusion joins Possibly the most efficient technique, depending upon the application, is to use an exclusion join against a list of all legal values (for example, an integers table).

        This article explains how comparing DATETIME and SMALLDATETIME values in SQL Server 2000 can introduce subtle bugs. I recently ran into a puzzling situation, which seemed like a bug in SQL Server 2000, but was in fact my fault. Even my sharpest colleagues were stumped. In fact, it turned out to be a fairly simple mistake.
The symptom was rows missing from a result. The problem was implicit data type casts.

        Window&rsquo;s XP&rsquo;s integrated ZIP functionality (built into Windows Explorer) is not trustworthy. You should not rely on it to correctly unzip or show the contents of archives. The problem is related to special characters in filenames. If a filename has one of the forbidden characters, Windows XP simply doesn&rsquo;t extract or show the files. A recent example is the 9rules media kit, which 9rules sent me when I was accepted to the network.

        Microsoft SQL Query Analyzer prints out statistics as text, and it can be tough to wade through it all. Here is an awk script for quickly analyzing those statistics.
Analyzing the stats First, remember you can use SQL Server Profiler to measure your query&rsquo;s performance. Profiler is a very powerful tool, and everyone writing queries should be familiar with it.
For one-off queries, though, it may be faster to simply turn on the desired statistics and run the query, then grab the output and analyze it directly.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Nov 25, 2005</span>
        Using DIV tags and CSS to format a single text into multiple columns is just as bad as using tables for layout. This article explains why.
Everyone agrees tables are not for layout, because tables are supposed to contain tabular data. Similarly, DIV elements aren&rsquo;t the right tool for columns, because they are supposed to group content into a generic container &ndash; either to group related elements simply for grouping&rsquo;s sake, or to identify actual content and apply meta-data such as language or class.

 below 11 are warnings, not errors 11-16 are available for use above 16 are system errors there is no behavioral difference among 11-16  The best thing to do is just get everyone to use the same value and reduce confusion.

        I recently did a technical review of How to Break Web Software: Functional and Security Testing of Web Applications and Web Services, by James A. Whittaker and Mike Andrews. My thoughts: it&rsquo;s well worth reading.
Though what I reviewed wasn&rsquo;t yet a final draft (my job was to help find technical and other errors, make suggestions on organizing the information and so forth), the content was (mostly) all there. I own other work by Whittaker, and I encourage anyone who&rsquo;s interested to read this book when it&rsquo;s published.
