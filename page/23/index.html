        ASUS-UL30A-X5
I&rsquo;ve had an ASUS-UL30A-X5 for about two weeks now. This is the nicest laptop I&rsquo;ve ever owned (and I was a laptop owner before that was cool). I&rsquo;m absolutely thrilled.
I used a Dell Inspiron 1501 for the last 4 years, the AMD model. Everything was a pain due to poor Linux compatibility. I blamed some of it on other things. For example, I thought my external monitor was low quality because all the pixels crawled like ants.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Mar 16, 2010</span>
        We have an early draft of a new tool available for you to use and test. It uses heuristics to find problems in SQL. Please use it and give feedback! Here&rsquo;s how:
$ wget http://www.maatkit.org/trunk/mk-query-advisor $ perl mk-query-advisor /var/log/mysql/slow.log  By default it consumes a log file in MySQL&rsquo;s slow query log format, but it can also parse the general-log format, and if you have any other kind of log you can feed it through mk-query-digest to transform the log into something it can recognize.

        It seems that a lot of people equate non-SQL databases with non-relational-ness, or malign the word relational. This is pretty much pure ignorance. If you&rsquo;ve ever uttered a sentence that includes the phrase &ldquo;&hellip;non-relational database&hellip;&rdquo; then I have two suggestions for you.
 Study relational algebra. At a bare minimum, read the Wikipedia article on relational algebra. There is much more you could do &ndash; take a class on the topic, or read C.

        I&rsquo;ve been noticing an undeniable trend in my consulting engagements in the last year or so, and when I vocalized this today, heads nodded all around me. Everyone sees a growth in the number of cases where otherwise well-optimized systems are artificially limited by InnoDB contention problems.
A year ago, I simply wasn&rsquo;t seeing the need for analysis of GDB backtraces en masse. These days, I&rsquo;m writing custom tools to gather and analyze backtraces.

        One of my colleagues, Ryan Lowe, has just heard that his session on PCI compliance with MySQL has been accepted at the upcoming MySQL conference. Ryan is highly qualified to present this topic, and not many people can say that; I certainly can&rsquo;t claim that title myself. If you&rsquo;re looking to learn how to make your MySQL installation PCI-compliant, there&rsquo;s also not a lot of trustworthy information online. Personally &ndash; and really, no bias just because he&rsquo;s my colleague &ndash; I think this is a great session for the MySQL conference, which I sometimes thought didn&rsquo;t have enough diversity of topics in past years.

        Which is better? I don&rsquo;t know, because I&rsquo;m a Vim user, so it&rsquo;s a moot point for me. But I have not noticed any Emacs-style keyboard shortcuts on websites. To the contrary, it seems like everything is Vim-style &ndash; certainly most Google apps are Vim-ish, and even Firefox is Vim-ish (press the / key to start searching for text on the page). Based on this highly scientific criterion, I declare Vim the winner.

        I&rsquo;ll be helping Morgan Tocker deliver the second half of his training course for MySQL Developers/DBAs in New York City in a few days (more Percona training). It was a snap decision at the last minute, but I&rsquo;m hoping I&rsquo;ll still get to meet some folks there. If we&rsquo;ve corresponded over email or blog comments and you would like to get together, ping me in the comments here!
If you&rsquo;re in the New York City area and you use MySQL, you should consider attending this course, too.

        Cary Millsap has a concise, readable paper on performance. Anyone involved in database performance optimization should read it.

It&rsquo;s one of the top books on my Essential Books List.

        The headline is flame-bait, don&rsquo;t take it. I just wanted to point something out about character sets and collations in MySQL.
To the uninitiated, it may seem overwhelming. Everything has a character set! Everything has a collation! And they act weirdly! The server has one. The database has one (oh, and it changes magically as I USE different databases.) Every table has one, and columns too. Is that all? NO! My connection has one!

 mk-query-digest is a powerful open-source tool for capturing, filtering, transforming, and aggregating queries, with the ability to do all sorts of other advanced tasks too. By default, it aggregates similar queries together and presents a designed-for-DBAs report with statistics about the most important queries, so you can see where to focus your optimization efforts.

I&rsquo;m hoping that people will give this a spin in the real world. I have lots of test cases, but that&rsquo;s never enough; I&rsquo;m looking for people to crunch their logs and let me know if anything breaks.

I should have read this book a long time ago, and it&rsquo;s my loss that I didn&rsquo;t. Although the title makes it sound like it should only benefit those who&rsquo;ll be changing the MySQL server&rsquo;s own code, that&rsquo;s not true. To the contrary, at least parts of this book should be required reading for DBAs and developers who use MySQL, after they gain a moderate level of familiarity with how to use the server.

        I explored two interesting topics today while learning more about Postgres.
Partial page writes PostgreSQL&rsquo;s partial page write protection is configured by the following setting, which defaults to &ldquo;on&rdquo;:
 full_page_writes (boolean)
When this parameter is on, the PostgreSQL server writes the entire content of each disk page to WAL during the first modification of that page after a checkpoint… Storing the full page image guarantees that the page can be correctly restored, but at a price in increasing the amount of data that must be written to WAL.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Feb 7, 2010</span>
        Many times I&rsquo;ve heard people advise on &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; for a MySQL database. This often includes routine maintenance, such as &ldquo;you should run OPTIMIZE TABLE on all of your InnoDB tables once a week to defragment them for better performance.&rdquo;
But this advice is unsubstantiated and could even be detrimental. Here are some of the obvious problems that I can think of:
 The optimized table compacts the primary key (clustered index) to its default 15/16ths fill factor per page.

Some of the proposals are sales pitches, infomercials, or just generally BS, but there&rsquo;s a gang of sharp-eyed people on the committee who are digging into who submits the proposals, what their company does, etc. Those sessions are getting shot down with bluntly honest reviews and low votes.

        I&rsquo;d like an UNTIL clause, please. I&rsquo;d use it sort of like LIMIT in MySQL and PostgreSQL, except that it would define when to stop returning looking for rows, instead of defining how many to return. Example:
SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY user_id UNTIL user_id = 100; That would select users up to and including user 99. Ideally the clause could accept any boolean predicate, including subqueries. I&rsquo;ll hold my breath and wait for this wish to come true now.
