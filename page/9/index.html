        I usually keep pretty quiet on things that are controversial, and goodness knows you can start a holy war fast with any comments about REST web services. But I&rsquo;ve been thinking and working on these things for years &ndash; REST for over a year, SOAP and friends since 2003 &ndash; and maybe my opinions will be interesting to someone.
I dislike SOAP. I&rsquo;ve worked a lot with it, doing about a dozen major integrations with platforms from companies like Amazon, Google, and Yahoo, using several different programming languages, primarily .

        Terminal-based, keystroke-driven editors are enormously powerful, and I still haven&rsquo;t seen anything more powerful than Vim. I&rsquo;m a longtime Vim user, and although I&rsquo;m not the world&rsquo;s foremost jaw-dropping expert on Vim, I would call myself an advanced power user at the very least, and probably a true expert. Still, I have maintained a relationship with GUI text editors over the years, too. An editor that has an insertion point for a cursor, and &ldquo;native&rdquo; mouse interaction, has an appeal I&rsquo;ve never quite shaken.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Nov 15, 2012</span>
        With the Big Data craze that&rsquo;s sweeping the world of technology right now, I often ask myself whether we&rsquo;re deficit-spending, so to speak, with our data consumption habits. I&rsquo;ve seen repeated examples of being unwilling to get rid of data, even though it&rsquo;s unused and nobody can think of a future use for it. At the same time, much Big Data processing I&rsquo;ve seen is brute-force and costly: hitting a not-very-valuable nut with a giant, expensive sledgehammer.

        Better performance is important in everything, not just MySQL. I don&rsquo;t want to wait for my text editor to open a file or perform syntax highlighting. I don&rsquo;t want to wait for my version control system to compute diffs or update my copy of the code with other peoples&rsquo; changes. I don&rsquo;t want to wait for my code to compile. I don&rsquo;t want to wait, period.
Two tools I have enjoyed recently are Git and the Go language.

        Over the years I&rsquo;ve had a lot of hand and arm problems from using a keyboard too much. For the last couple of years, though, I&rsquo;ve been pain-free and twitch-free. (There was an extended time when my little fingers and thumbs spasmed annoyingly day and night.)
There are lots of different kinds of keyboarding injuries, and lots of different solutions to them. I&rsquo;ve changed my chair, my keyboard, my keyboard layout, my desk height, and so on.

        I was just skimming through the latest &ldquo;Meet the Experts&rdquo; podcast from Oracle, whose topic is debugging stored routines in MySQL. The tl;dr (tl;dl?) version is if you&rsquo;re working with Windows and .NET, you can install a Visual Studio plugin that lets you debug stored routines in the server via the .NET connection libraries. That&rsquo;s pretty nice, for those who are using that platform. The podcast is only a few minutes, so if you&rsquo;re interested, by all means listen to it, or take a look at the documentation.

        I&rsquo;ve been doing a little bit of programming in Go recently, and really enjoying it. It&rsquo;s an awesome language with really solid libraries. It reminds me a lot of the .NET framework in that it&rsquo;s well-thought-out, but the Go language itself is a lot smaller, less formal, and a lot more expressive than I ever found C# to be. And that&rsquo;s saying a lot &ndash; C# was my previous favorite language, along with the occasional Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, and &ndash; gasp &ndash; Visual Basic 6.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Oct 30, 2012</span>
        MySQL&rsquo;s SHOW STATUS and SHOW VARIABLES commands (or queries against the corresponding INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables) don&rsquo;t always show what they say. In particular, SHOW STATUS contains several rows that aren&rsquo;t status-related, but are really configuration variables in my opinion (and it is an opinion &ndash; sometimes the difference isn&rsquo;t black and white).
Here&rsquo;s a short list of some status counters that I think are really better off as configuration variables:
 Innodb_page_size Replica_heartbeat_period Ssl_cipher Ssl_cipher_list Ssl_ctx_verify_depth Ssl_ctx_verify_mode Ssl_default_timeout Ssl_session_cache_mode Ssl_verify_depth Ssl_verify_mode Ssl_version  Most of those are legacy, but Replica_heartbeat_period is a recent addition.

        Last night I wrote about trending data with a moving average, and then after I went to bed, I realized I made a mistake on the chart I showed. I calculated &alpha; for the exponentially weighted moving average so that the average age of metrics approaches 60 samples as time approaches infinity, and I plotted that on the same chart with a 60-sample simple moving average.
I&rsquo;ve made this mistake several times before.

        In my recent talk at Surge and Percona Live about adaptive fault detection (slides), I claimed that hardcoded thresholds for alerting about error conditions are usually best to avoid in favor of dynamic or adaptive thresholds. (I actually went much further than that and said that it&rsquo;s possible to detect faults with great confidence in many systems like MySQL, without setting any thresholds at all.)
In this post I want to explain a little more about the moving averages I used for determining &ldquo;normal&rdquo; behavior in the examples I gave.

        How do you connect to and converse with your database of choice (MySQL, in my case)? Chances are it&rsquo;s largely formed by the programming language you choose. I&rsquo;ve worked with a variety of programming languages. Anytime I begin learning a new one, I am reminded again that there&rsquo;s more than one way to skin a cat.
Over the last few years, I&rsquo;ve mostly programmed in Perl and shell. The shell interface to MySQL is simple: the mysql command-line tool.

        Do you ever find yourself wanting to open several terminal windows and send the same commands to all of them? I&rsquo;ve had this need many times, and I&rsquo;ve never found a completely satisfactory solution. I&rsquo;ve also known a lot of people who&rsquo;ve written various sets of scripts to help them accomplish such tasks.
In no particular order, here are a few ways I&rsquo;ve done this in the past:
 Facebook&rsquo;s pmysql client The dsh tool Several screen windows named remoteXXX, followed by a bash for-loop: while read cmd; do screen -X at remote# stuff &quot;$cmd&quot;; done Using many PuTTY windows and the puttycs tool Opening many tabs in KDE&rsquo;s Kterm tool and selecting the options to send input to all tabs  Here are some I&rsquo;ve heard about, but never used:

        As I&rsquo;ve become a better shell programmer over the last year or two, I&rsquo;ve been surprised to discover some tools I didn&rsquo;t know about. It eventually dawned on me, as I did more and more brute-force processing of large datasets, as well as some of the more delicate things that went into Aspersa -&gt; Percona Toolkit, that many tasks I used to do with SQL and spreadsheets can be accomplished easily with well-structured text files and Unix utilities.

        Mark Leith writes that it&rsquo;s time to say goodbye to SHOW PROCESSLIST in MySQL 5.6, and use the Performance Schema replacement for it instead, because the older tools cause some blocking, and the Performance Schema replacement is completely non-blocking.
On the face of it that&rsquo;s a good thing, but I wonder whether we&rsquo;ll want to keep some blocking functionality around anyway. Inspecting systems that are doing concurrent work can be hard unless you can see a variety of views on them.

They&rsquo;re trying by hand because automated attempts are blocked and the server simply doesn&rsquo;t respond. Hand-submitting spam doesn&rsquo;t scale, so only a few have popped up on my admin screen.
Have fun, I.P. addresses 173.213.212.234 and 219.91.208.244 (remember the Internet isn&rsquo;t anonymous). If you look around this blog you won&rsquo;t notice any spam comments. There&rsquo;s a reason for that &ndash; a combination of reasons, actually.
