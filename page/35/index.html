        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jun 24, 2008</span>
        Percona is looking to hire someone to develop Maatkit, among other things.
If I weren&rsquo;t having so much fun being the consulting team lead, I&rsquo;d be doing it myself. (In fact, I&rsquo;m still hacking on it a lot. Got some pretty fun stuff done this weekend.) I don&rsquo;t know what the rest of the world thinks, but I think Maatkit is a damn enjoyable project to work on. Hopefully someone else will have the same kind of mindset and want to get paid for it, unlike poor working-on-the-weekends me.

        My post on what it&rsquo;s like to write a technical book was a stream-of-consciousness look at the process of writing High Performance MySQL, Second Edition. I got a lot of responses from it and learned some neat things I wouldn&rsquo;t have learned if I hadn&rsquo;t written the post. I also got a lot of questions, and my editor wrote a response too. I want to follow up on these things.

        The other day I was explaining options to someone who wanted to know about archiving data in MySQL. &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I might have to code my app to look for the data in two places?&rdquo; The disadvantage of this is that his app might be more complex. Another disadvantage is that it might take two queries &ndash; if you look for a user in the usual location and it&rsquo;s not there, you have to look for it elsewhere.

        Update, almost a year later: Take this with a grain of salt. I wrote it after an incredible marathon of staying up most of the night for months on end. My take on it now that I have some distance from the project is -- I'd definitely work with Andy Oram and O'Reilly again, and I'd be able to make the process a lot easier for myself the second time.

        Today High Performance MySQL, Second Edition went to press. I&rsquo;ve been working with the production team over the last couple of weeks, proofreading and checking the index and working with the artist who re-drew the illustrations.
I spoke to the production editor this morning and she told me the schedule is for the bound-book date to be the 16th of June. The official in-stock date is June 19th. I don&rsquo;t know how many copies they&rsquo;re printing for the first printing.

        Before I tell you what&rsquo;s new, let me tell you how cool I think it would be if Maatkit were voted Sourceforge.net project of the year. Just something to think about :-) I suggest the &ldquo;Best Tool or Utility for SysAdmins&rdquo; category. You can actually click the Back button and nominate it for several categories. Not that anyone would do that, of course.
Also, if anyone wants to jump in and help out with bug fixes and new features, please, by all means.

        I just uploaded the 1.0.0 release of my MySQL templates for Cacti. Now there&rsquo;s an actual download under the Downloads tab. I solved a number of issues in this release. The changelog:
 VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers MySQL performance monitoring and PostgreSQL performance management among many other features.

        In preparation for the book&rsquo;s launch next month, I&rsquo;ve created a website for it: High Performance MySQL. You may notice that the URL isn&rsquo;t the same as the site for the first edition. It proved to be difficult to transfer that domain. If we accomplish it later on, I&rsquo;ll set up a redirect.
Why an official site? To give you free stuff, of course. Final drafts of the front matter (TOC, preface, foreword), a sample chapter, and the index are there already.

        MySQL's version numbering is getting harder and harder to understand. In fact, it's getting surreal.
Let me state up front that there's probably a lot I don't know here. But if I don't know, how on earth can the general public figure it out?
Before we begin, let's define terms: GA is completely done, ready for use. RC is a release candidate: don't change anything, just fix bugs because we're charging towards a release here.

 ...the volume of patches [to PostgreSQL] has risen dramatically during the past few years.  This is total hearsay &ndash; I don&rsquo;t have hard numbers, haven&rsquo;t verified it myself, etc etc. But consider the source!
What can be responsible for this increase in patches to PostgreSQL?

        I have been using Maatkit in a different way since I joined Percona as a consultant. When I&rsquo;m working on a system now, it&rsquo;s a new, unfamiliar system &ndash; not one where I have already installed my favorite programs. And that means I want to grab my favorite productivity tools fast.
I intentionally wrote the Maatkit tools so they don&rsquo;t need to be &ldquo;installed.&rdquo; You just run them, that&rsquo;s all. But I never made them easy to download.

Probably not, unless you check the DNS of xaprb.com regularly!
Don&rsquo;t you hate it when people say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m moving my blog, I hope there won&rsquo;t be more than a few days of downtime, blah blah&hellip;&rdquo; Why is this ever necessary, I wonder? I wonder the same thing about a lot of hosting providers &ndash; recently I had a client in my consulting practice whose (very large, well-known) hosting provider tried to help them with some very simple MySQL work and ended up causing them an obscene amount of downtime, like many many days, and there was no end in sight.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, May 18, 2008</span>
        There is much discussion of why MySQL is more widely adopted than PostgreSQL. The discussion I&rsquo;ve heard is mostly among the PostgreSQL community members, who believe their favorite database server is better in many ways, and are sometimes puzzled why people would choose an inferior product.
There are also many comparison charts that show one server is better than the other in some ways. These don&rsquo;t really seem to help people with this question, either!

        <span class="post-date">Wed, May 14, 2008</span>
        The title of MySQL&rsquo;s website states that they are the world&rsquo;s most popular open-source database. This is false; MySQL is not an open-source database. That assertion is a fact, not an opinion.
MySQL is Free Software, licensed under the GNU GPL. People frequently use the two phrases &ldquo;Free Software&rdquo; and &ldquo;Open Source Software&rdquo; as synonyms, but there are very large, very important differences.
The difference between Free and Open Source Open Source is much more of a development methodology than a philosophical standpoint.

        **Update: ** Karanbir says &ldquo;Just one thing to keep in mind is that we dont want too many people using it from the Testing repository &#8211; we only need enough feedback to move it from testing to stable ( and to be honest, there are already 8 people who have said yes it works &#8211; so move to stable should happen within the next 24 &#8211; 48 hrs ). Once the package is in stable, users on CentOS4 and 5 wont need to do anything more than just &lsquo;yum install maatkit&rsquo; and it will install for them.

This is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen the entire production schedule. The book is supposed to go to the printer in the first week of June.

        Yesterday I went to beCamp 2008 along with four roomfuls of other people interested in technology (perhaps close to 100 people total). The conference was a lot of fun. Not everything went as planned, but that was as planned. This was an Open Spaces conference and I thought it worked very well. From an email Eric Pugh sent:
 Basically it all boils down to:
Open Space is the Law of Two Feet: if anyone finds themselves in a place where they are neither learning nor contributing they should move to somewhere more productive.
