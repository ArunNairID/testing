        It has all played itself out according to Microsoft&rsquo;s wishes. They have railroaded through a so-called standard for document representation, gotten it rubber-stamped by so-called standards bodies, and fought their way past all the objections of sensible people and companies. In the process, lots of developing nations have been steamrolled, too. Shame, shame, shame.

        <p>Over in <a href="http://www.maatkit.org/">Maatkit</a>-land, <a href="http://hackmysql.com/">Daniel Nichter</a> and I practice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">test-first programming, AKA test-driven development</a>. That is, we write tests for each new feature or to catch regressions on each bug we fix. And &ndash; this is crucial &ndash; we write the tests <em>before</em> we write the code.* The tests should initially fail, which is a validation that the new code actually works and the tests actually verify this. If we don&rsquo;t first write a failing testcase, then our code lacks a very important guarantee: &ldquo;if you break this code, then the test case will tell you so.&rdquo; (A test that doesn&rsquo;t fail when the code fails isn&rsquo;t worth writing.)</p>

        Dear LazyWeb, I want to use my Ubuntu laptop (on amd64 BTW) to build an RPM of Maatkit that will work on all RPM-based distros. Is it possible? Or are there enough differences between the RPM-based distros that I can&rsquo;t do it? Mind you, the finished RPM ought to just have some man pages and Perl scripts, so I don&rsquo;t think it will be platform- or distro-specific. But I am just not an expert on it.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Aug 6, 2008</span>
        This post is SEO bait for people trying to scale MySQL&rsquo;s write capacity by writing to both servers in master-master replication. The short answer: you can&rsquo;t do it. It&rsquo;s impossible.
I keep hearing this line of reasoning: &ldquo;if I make a MySQL replication &lsquo;cluster&rsquo; and move half the writes to machine A and half of them to machine B, I can increase my overall write capacity.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a fallacy. All writes are repeated on both machines: the writes you do on machine A are repeated via replication on machine B, and vice versa.

        Just thought I&rsquo;d update you. We got quite a few good errata from readers, and I took a couple weekends and went through the book with a fine-toothed comb, catching typos and subtle errors that crept in at some point (TPC benchmarks were labeled as TCP benchmarks &ndash; did you catch that one?). I marked up my book and mailed it to O&rsquo;Reilly, who went well above and beyond what they normally do for errata.

        Have you ever run a command on a Unix-like system and then realized it&rsquo;ll take a really long time, and you want to log out of the computer and leave it running? Or maybe you&rsquo;ve connected over SSH to a remote server and executed a command that will take a while, and you&rsquo;re really worried that your network connection will fail and kill the command.
There are several ways to log out without stopping the command.

        Hooray! The MySQL reference manual has a new search system. It now uses a Google Appliance and the results should be a lot better. The old system was not very helpful. It used to break config variables into multiple words and search on them individually and give a billion results I didn&rsquo;t care about. I&rsquo;ve just tried to search for some things like key_buffer_size and got results I think are very useful.

        Someone who should know told me that LinkedIn runs its main application on Oracle. So when I saw the press release about MySQL being their database, I read carefully, and they are not very specific about exactly what MySQL is used for. Depending on how you read it, you could argue that they left open the possibility that the main application database is not MySQL, and the MySQL deal is for something peripheral.

        My editor Andy Oram recently sent me an ACM article on BASE, a technique for improving scalability by being willing to give up some other properties of traditional transactional systems.
It&rsquo;s a really good read. In many ways it is the same religion everyone who&rsquo;s successfully scaled a system Really Really Big has advocated. But this is different: it&rsquo;s a very clear article, with a great writing style that really cuts out the fat and teaches the principles without being specific to any environment or sounding egotistical.

        I just finished reading Building Powerful and Robust Websites with Drupal 6 (this title on Packt&rsquo;s site). I&rsquo;ve been working on a website powered by Drupal, and though it was obvious that Drupal is very flexible and capable, I was getting pretty lost in the website. So I wanted to read a book that would explain it to me.
Unfortunately, this book didn&rsquo;t help me much. I&rsquo;d give it 2 out of 5 stars.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Jul 17, 2008</span>
        I have been getting a lot of comments and errata from people who seem to be mistakenly buying the first edition and believing it&rsquo;s the second edition. A lot of the blame for this probably rests with Amazon, who did not distinguish between the two editions at all until the editor and I (among others) leaned on them persistently for about 6 weeks. I think some people are buying the second edition and getting the first edition.

        Apparently High Performance MySQL, 2nd Edition is selling quite well &ndash; I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how well &ndash; because we&rsquo;re preparing for a second printing. This makes me very happy. I don&rsquo;t think they anticipated going back to the press for quite some time.
The book fluctuates between sales rank 1000 and 2000 on Amazon during the day, and has reached as high as 600 or so. This is just phenomenal.

        The Sphinx project just released version 0.9.8, with many enhancements since the previous release. There&rsquo;s never been a better time to try it out. It&rsquo;s really cool technology.
What is Sphinx? Glad you asked. It&rsquo;s fast, efficient, scalable, relevant full-text searching and a heck of a lot more. In fact, Sphinx complements MySQL for a lot of non-search queries that MySQL frankly isn&rsquo;t very good at, including WHERE clauses on low-selectivity columns, ORDER BY with a LIMIT and OFFSET, and GROUP BY.

        Dear reader, this is a challenge. How&rsquo;s your MySQL prowess? You know about LIMIT: it cuts off the results at the specified number.
mysql&gts; select actor_id from sakila.actor where actor_id % 5 = 0 limit 5; +----------+ | actor_id | +----------+ | 5 | | 10 | | 15 | | 20 | | 25 | +----------+ 5 rows in set (0.00 sec) But that query actually accessed 25 rows.

        The book is done now, right? What&rsquo;s next?
Don&rsquo;t tell my wife this, but a book is never done.
Right now I&rsquo;m proofreading the printed copy. I proofread PDF after PDF during production, but some problems will always slip through and make it to paper. I&rsquo;m finding quite a few little mistakes. For example, at one point we refer to TPC as TCP three times in a row. Oops.
These problems will be corrected in the next printing.
