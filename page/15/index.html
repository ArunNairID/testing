        <span class="post-date">Mon, Sep 19, 2011</span>
        I&rsquo;ve never objected to someone making money from MySQL. I&rsquo;ve only expressed disappointment that they weren&rsquo;t doing it effectively enough. As I have predicted many times, Oracle is good at this. Oracle is the number one reason I didn&rsquo;t start a new career in some other database a few years ago. Oracle is making MySQL more successful not only for Oracle, but also for the users, the community, and the competition.

        I thought that Postgres Open 2011 was very well done. I liked the content, the location, and most especially the atmosphere, which felt much more welcoming than some PostgreSQL conferences I&rsquo;ve attended. This last point bears repeating: I&rsquo;d exceeded my tolerance for trash talk about MySQL at other conferences, and this event made me feel valued again. I believe that the leaders and organizers set the tone, so I think that Selena and the committee deserve a lot of credit and thanks for the warm atmosphere.

I work for Percona, a MySQL consulting company. To augment my memory, I keep a quick-reference text file with notes on interesting issues that customers ask us to solve. One of the categories of frequent problems is attempts to build a job queue in MySQL. I have so many URLs under this bullet point that I stopped keeping track anymore. Customers have endless problems with job queues in their databases.

        I have just signed the contract for High Performance MySQL, Third Edition. The third edition will include major updates and new content in these areas:
 Recent performance and reliability advances, particularly in MySQL 5.5 and the InnoDB storage engine. A new chapter on using MySQL in cloud computing environments. Updates on modern hardware, including many CPUs, large memory, and solid-state storage. Improvements in clustering and high availability, including middleware and third-party solutions.

        I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve said this before, but I absolutely love VirtualBox. It makes it so easy to run Windows in the cases where I have to for a client&rsquo;s silly Windows-only VPN software or something like that. Windows runs better inside VirtualBox than it does on bare hardware.
One of the tricks I use constantly is to set up a bunch of VirtualBox instances with a common (shared) base disk image.

There are major topics that it omits entirely or mentions only tangentially, such as distributed searching across a cluster of machines, real-time updating of indexes and attributes, and so on.

        Boy, the conference planners here must have some pull in high places, because they got a 5.9 earthquake to help them with their &ldquo;Shake IT Up&rdquo; slogan for Innovation Nation and GOSCON. I was in the upstairs conference hall, and it was pretty dramatic. I&rsquo;ve never seen/felt/experienced anything quite like that before. All the walls were twisting and shimmying in different directions, and fixtures fell out of the ceiling. Just little ones &ndash; but I decided not to rush to the exit, as I was in a huge room and others were already rushing.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Aug 21, 2011</span>
        It seems to be a popular misconception that mk-slave-prefetch is designed to keep a MySQL replica server &ldquo;warm&rdquo; and ready to serve production traffic in case the master is demoted or fails. This is not what mk-slave-prefetch does. It&rsquo;s related, and easy to confuse, but its purpose is different.
The mk-slave-prefetch tool is designed to try to execute a read-only approximation of the write workload that the replica is about to have to perform.

        I am writing this on my blog because I want to take the Percona hat off (partially) and wear my community hat a bit. My loyalty was to the MySQL community long before I was involved with Percona.
There are now three Percona Live events for which we have signed venue contracts and begun plans: London in October, Washington DC in January, and Santa Clara in April. I have insider knowledge of what&rsquo;s going on with planning all three events, and I&rsquo;m proud and happy that I have a community-member seat at the table.

This is a research-based session that presents an easy-to-digest post-mortem of hundreds of emergency issues filed by Percona customers. The real causes and types of downtime surprised me quite a bit, and the preventions run counter to a lot of conventional wisdom. I&rsquo;ll just give a preview by saying that you should consider it a top priority to monitor how full your disks are!

Everything important you do in your professional life is about communication. The ability to write clearly and concisely, with at least approximately correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation, is vital.
Despite what some people say to me on a regular basis, I am not &ldquo;a natural&rdquo; at this. I thought I was when I entered college.

        I recently set up the solarized color theme for my terminal emulator. I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do this for a while, but procrastinated. However, I finally got really frustrated with the colors I get from &ldquo;ls&rdquo; sometimes &ndash; I use a dark terminal with light fonts, and the directory listings in particular can become invisible, with dark blue on black.
Solarized is much improved. All of the colors work well together and are easy on the eyes.

        I&rsquo;ll be speaking at Surge again this year. This time, unlike last year&rsquo;s talk, I&rsquo;m tackling a very concrete topic: extracting scalability and performance metrics from TCP network traffic. It turns out that most things that communicate over TCP can be analyzed very elegantly just by capturing arrival and departure timestamps of packets, nothing more. I&rsquo;ll show examples where different views on the same data pull out completely different insights about the application, even though we have no information about the application itself (okay, I actually know that it&rsquo;s a MySQL database, and a lot about the actual database and workload, but I don&rsquo;t need that in order to do what I&rsquo;ll show you).
