        <span class="post-date">Sun, Mar 8, 2009</span>
        I think it&rsquo;s occasionally interesting to look back at what people wrote about things while they were happening, especially after big changes (founder and CEO leaving, for example). Here&rsquo;s a blog post from May of 2008, by Henrik Ingo and Ignacio Torres, about MySQL&rsquo;s business model. No commentary &ndash; just the link.

        If you&rsquo;ve been holding out for that golden opportunity, now&rsquo;s a great time to get involved in Maatkit.
Until now I haven&rsquo;t really made a conscious effort to open-source the decision process and get people involved; Maatkit has been largely driven by so-called &ldquo;real-world needs,&rdquo; as perceived through my little lens on the world (and emails from the whole Percona team telling me when something&rsquo;s wrong). I guess I am likely to remain some kind of benevolent dictator, because I created Maatkit and historically I&rsquo;m the main hacker.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Mar 7, 2009</span>
        After I wrote about things you need to know about MySQL backups, a customer contacted me and asked me what I know about SecoBackup for MySQL. I see it has a very low cost and Percona has Amazon accounts for testing purposes, so I quickly downloaded s3sql_2.2.0.1-2.01_i386.deb, installed it, configured it, and gave it a whirl.
Since I just want to see what it does to take a backup, I started up a sandbox running from /tmp/12345 and configured it to backup msandbox:msandbox@127.

        A while ago I switched my theme to Journalist (link at the very bottom of the page) because I thought it was well laid out and solidly designed &ndash; I mean it uses sensible CSS and XHTML etc. The only thing I didn&rsquo;t care for was that it was a little too minimal, if anything. There are lots of themes out there that look gorgeous, but when I tested them they don&rsquo;t render right.

        My employer has been looking for a company who can provide us with phone service designed for a decentralized, virtual-office consulting and support workforce, and after extensive surveying of the options, every single one comes up short on features, quality, or support. You can have one or sometimes two, but not all three, and we don&rsquo;t really see signs of it getting better. There&rsquo;s a real race to the bottom in this industry.

        Sourceforge has reintroduced persistent login cookies. Here&rsquo;s the bug request I submitted about this, a long time ago.
The thing is, I don&rsquo;t really care much anymore. I&rsquo;ve moved my open-source projects off Sourceforge onto Google Code. I am about 10x more productive there.
This lesson can be applied to pretty much everything on the web these days. Make it even the slightest bit hard to use your service, and people will use what&rsquo;s easy instead.

        I&rsquo;m not sure this has been publicized much in the PostgreSQL world yet, but the Percona Performance Conference is not a MySQL-centric event. We&rsquo;re hoping for good sessions on PostgreSQL and lots of other topics. So this is an invitation &ndash; come attend, and submit sessions.
A few words about marketing. The event is free, and even though it&rsquo;s stamped with Percona&rsquo;s name and under Percona&rsquo;s control, it is a technical event.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Feb 21, 2009</span>
        I&rsquo;ve just finished reading Scalable Internet Architectures by Theo Schlossnagle. It&rsquo;s a great book. Anyone building large systems should read it. Heck, anyone building any system that needs to run on more than one server should read it.
The book got mixed reviews on Amazon, but I really think that&rsquo;s about writing style, not substance. Sometimes Theo takes the reader on a scenic tour of something that doesn&rsquo;t seem to have much to do with the subject matter, and then wraps up by showing how it is actually directly relevant.

I&rsquo;ve been seeing increasing amounts of this type of thing:
 MySQL server version: 5.0.67-percona-3 CATEGORY QUERY: SELECT wp_term_taxonomy.count as &lsquo;count&rsquo;, wp_terms.term_id, wp_terms.name, wp_terms.slug, wp_term_taxonomy.parent, wp_term_taxonomy.description FROM wp_terms, wp_term_taxonomy WHERE &hellip;
 Go to the page in question (sorry, I won&rsquo;t link it) and you don&rsquo;t see &ldquo;percona&rdquo; anywhere on it.

        I just returned from a MySQL Federal Migration Boot Camp, jointly presented by Carahsoft and Sun/MySQL. It was a half-day seminar on the topic of migrating applications to MySQL, targeted to the US Government sector. Specifically, most of the audience seemed to be running Oracle, though there were some users of other systems (Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase, Informix, etc).
Ronald Bradford presented the whole thing. I thought he did a great job giving a fair and balanced look at topics such as what types of applications are good candidates for migration, what gotchas you might encounter, etc.

        I keep reading that Ma.gnolia&rsquo;s data is permanently lost because &ldquo;a specialist had been unable to recover any data from the corrupted hard drive.&rdquo; This is not in itself a reason to consider data completely lost.
It is not clear to me whether the hard drive itself is unusable, e.g. the spindle won&rsquo;t spin and the head won&rsquo;t read the ones and zeroes, or whether the filesystem is corrupted. It sounds to me, from reading Larry Hallf&rsquo;s comments, like it&rsquo;s a simple matter of filesystem corruption.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Feb 17, 2009</span>
        <p>As you may know, MySQL has a dual-licensing model. You can get the source under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPL version 2</a>, or you can buy a commercial license.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve recently been hearing a lot of confusion about when you have to buy a commercial license. People I&rsquo;ve spoken to wrongly believe that they&rsquo;re required to purchase a license if they&rsquo;re going to use MySQL in anything but a not-for-profit business, for example. I don&rsquo;t know how these notions get started, but they do.</p>

<p>So when are you required to buy a commercial license? It&rsquo;s very simple: when you want to do something with MySQL that the GPL doesn&rsquo;t permit.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Feb 12, 2009</span>
        One of the most common patterns I see in my consulting work is identifiers that are generated by MD5() or UUID(). Many times this is done in an application framework or something similar &ndash; not software the client has written. From the application programmer&rsquo;s point of view, it&rsquo;s just an incredibly handy idiom: generate a unique value and use it, you&rsquo;re done.
Those values tend to appear in session identifiers, but that&rsquo;s not the only place; I especially notice them in apps that use Java&rsquo;s Hibernate interfaces, whether session IDs are involved or not.

        It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve sent any news about the MySQL Cacti Templates project I started a while ago. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new:
 VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers MySQL performance monitoring and PostgreSQL performance management among many other features.
  First of all, it&rsquo;s not just MySQL templates anymore.

But anyway I&rsquo;ve read as much as I can.
Obviously many people have been putting a ton of thought into this for years, and I can&rsquo;t pretend to judge their work in a single sitting.
