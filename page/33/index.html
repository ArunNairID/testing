        <span class="post-date">Thu, Oct 16, 2008</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;ve been working with a client recently who has <a href="http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/">SELinux</a> on his servers.  It has been quite a struggle sometimes.</p>

<p>My colleages tell me that SELinux has a pretty noticeable performance impact.  I am not sure if we have benchmarks to support this; at any rate, the client said it&rsquo;s OK, we&rsquo;ll take the performance hit.</p>

<p>There have been a few problems (Nagios can&rsquo;t run because it can&rsquo;t write to its own pid file, etc etc).  Last night there was something new: &ldquo;too many connections&rdquo; when trying to connect to MySQL.  As a result the site was down, and it wasn&rsquo;t possible to log in to MySQL and see why. But the oddest thing happened: mysqld would not shut down.  It was sitting basically idle, doing absolutely nothing, and wouldn&rsquo;t stop. There was nothing in any log files to show what might be going on.</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve released version 1.1.1 of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/">MySQL Cacti templates</a> I develop. The new templates work around more Cacti limitations, including the limitation on the length of the data returned from the poller script.

        Dear Lazyweb, quick question: once I&rsquo;ve USE-ed a database in MySQL, how can I un-USE it so I have no default database? Is it even possible?

        <p>This is part knowledge share, part appeal: fellow bloggers, I&rsquo;d comment a lot more on your blogs (and I want to!) if I could. Please, make it easy for me to comment &ndash; don&rsquo;t make me log in (I won&rsquo;t do it) or moderate me.

        I just wrote about how Maatkit has gotten some new features for helping people make sure their replicas have an exact copy of the master&rsquo;s data. This work was largely sponsored by one of Percona&rsquo;s customers, whose name I have permission to mention: Vantage Media.

Thanks Vantage! Your sponsorship helps many people and businesses.

        <p>I&rsquo;ve created a set of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mysql-cacti-templates/">Cacti templates for graphing stats about MySQL</a>. While these were based on several other people&rsquo;s work, there are many improvements.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Oct 4, 2008</span>
        <p>I have recently added some features to <a href="http://www.maatkit.org/">Maatkit&rsquo;s mk-table-checksum</a> tool that can make it easy to checksum the relevant parts of your data more frequently (i.e. <a href="http://www.drgrammar.org/faqs/#59">continually, but not continuously</a>). This in turn makes it possible for you to find out <em>much</em> sooner if a replica becomes different from its master, and then you can take action before the differences affect more of your data.</p>

        It&rsquo;s been a while since I have updated my JavaScript formatting and parsing functions, and people have been posting comments on them. Unfortunately my interests have really turned elsewhere, and I&rsquo;m not much in the world of frontend web design anymore. There&rsquo;s good news though: now I&rsquo;ve made it easy for you to get the code, change the code, document it, report issues on it, and so forth. I&rsquo;ve hosted the code at Google Code.

        I just thought I&rsquo;d drop a line about our book. Sales appear to be doing well still: the book is still at Amazon sales rank 3,213 and seems to hold pretty steady there. A lot of people have discovered it and are recommending it &ndash; including members of MySQL&rsquo;s professional services team. There are several positive reviews on Amazon (though if you like the book, a few more wouldn&rsquo;t hurt either).

        <p>There&rsquo;s a new release with a lot of goodies &ndash; speed, efficiency, user-friendliness, and new features.

If you need features, please ask Percona about it.</p>

<p><a href="http://hackmysql.com/">Daniel Nichter</a> has written most of the code for this release. Having a dedicated developer is really moving the project forward. Thanks Daniel!</p>

<p>If you check the issues list on the project&rsquo;s website you&rsquo;ll see we have some ambitious plans for the project, mostly driven by real-world needs from Percona&rsquo;s clients, many of whom run very large data centers and such. It makes me really happy that Maatkit is solving serious problems for which no other solution exists.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the changelog:</p>

        If you thought the activity around planning OpenSQL Camp 2008 had slacked off, it&rsquo;s only because I&rsquo;m both moving to a new house and traveling for business, so I haven&rsquo;t blogged about it. In reality I&rsquo;m not (and shouldn&rsquo;t be!) the main driving force behind this event, so my lack of blogging doesn&rsquo;t reflect anything about it, really.
That said, I&rsquo;d like to renew the call for really great sessions, especially from people who have built open-source databases.

        Sometimes there are funny communication styles between people who are geographically distributed and working together all the time. Recently one of our team members echoed back to me some answers I gave over a chat session:
 Q: Is it OK for me to buy quad-core servers?
A: The old man walks slow but carries much, whilst the young boy runs without a care.
 Okay, okay maybe I wasn&rsquo;t very clear in my message, and maybe it was just a little bit Confucian.

        Along with some others, I have arranged a conference for open-source database users and developers.
Key facts:
 It is of, by and for the community (you). At this event, all open-source databases are created equal. We&rsquo;ll learn together and grow together. It&rsquo;s a combination conference and hackathon. It&rsquo;s free. It is Friday night Nov 14, 18:00 through Sun the 16th at 18:00 in Charlottesville, Virginia USA in a very cool location.

<p>I think this is conflating two completely distinct properties of a monitoring solution. <a href="http://www.cacti.net/">Cacti</a> is extremely extensible, with a plugin-based architecture and templates and all kinds of other goodies; yet it is not agent-based (actually it lets you choose &ndash; now that&rsquo;s extensibility). <a href="http://code.google.com/p/innotop/">innotop</a> is not agent-based, and it&rsquo;s extremely extensible too. Basically everything inside innotop is a lookup table of anonymous subroutines and data structures that you can tweak pretty much infinitely with plugins and configuration files that get merged into the running code dynamically. Extensibility is completely orthogonal to whether the architecture is agent-based. What about WordPress? It&rsquo;s ridiculously extensible and it has nothing to do with agents.</p>

<p>So now that we&rsquo;ve clarified that, what can we say about agent-based or agentless architectures? Which is better?</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Aug 19, 2008</span>
        <p>I got some interesting comments on my previous article about <a href="/blog/2008/08/18/how-maatkit-benefits-from-test-driven-development/">unit testing Maatkit</a>, including echoes of my own conversion to the unit-testing religion. One of the objections I&rsquo;ve heard a lot about unit-testing is how it&rsquo;s impossible to test code that talks to a database. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too hard,&rdquo; they say. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s easy to test a module that calculates a square root, but a database? Way too much work!&rdquo;</p>
