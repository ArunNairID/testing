        A while ago I wrote about a tool to help make upgrades safer. Since then, we have gotten several people to help sponsor development on this tool, and a few of our customers are using it to help find problems before they upgrade their systems.
I can&rsquo;t think of a single one of the Maatkit tools that didn&rsquo;t grow out of the need for deeper insight into some part of the system.

        Maatkit version 4334 is ready for download. I see that I missed posting a release announcement about last month&rsquo;s release of Maatkit. I&rsquo;ll try to cover the important bits about the last two releases here. Daniel has been posting the release announcements to the mailing list recently, so I&rsquo;ll do a bit of copy and paste of what he said too.
We&rsquo;ve released two new tools. These are mk-upgrade and mk-log-player.

        Ryan posted an article on the MySQL Performance Blog about how to use mk-query-digest to analyze and understand your memcached usage with the same techniques you use for MySQL query analysis. This is an idea that came to me during the 2009 MySQL Conference, while talking to our friends from Schooner, who sell a memcached appliance.
It suddenly struck me that the science of memcached performance is basically nonexistent, from the standpoint of developers and architects.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Jul 12, 2009</span>
        If you don&rsquo;t like DRM (Digital Restrictions Management), there are lots of ways to protest it. One of the simplest and most effective is to pick a massively popular DRM&rsquo;ed device, and express your dismay to the manufacturer and users. Here&rsquo;s an idea:
 Browse to the DRM-laden Amazon Kindle&rsquo;s product page. Look for reviews that mention the problems with its DRM. Mark them as helpful.  Here is a selection of such reviews, in which the reviewers rightly protest the restrictions, even though some of them are not really educated about DRM per se:

        I just adore Google Code. But the default wiki view (a list of pages, sorted by last-modified) is lacking something. Fortunately, it&rsquo;s fixable. Here&rsquo;s the before:
Default wiki list  And here&rsquo;s the after:
Wiki with sidebar and default page  Here&rsquo;s how:
 Create a wiki page called TableOfContents, or something like that. Using normal wiki syntax, enter links and text for your table of contents. The best way to do this is to use bulleted lists to organize and outline the pages.

        My brother sent me these thoughts, slightly edited:
 Recently I looked at the [Wikipedia] Linux page. To my surprise it&rsquo;s not about the kernel Linux, it&rsquo;s about the &ldquo;OS&rdquo;. I looked at discussion and it appears that by general consensus the term Linux applies to the unix like operating system, and so it is correct for Wikipedia to follow that consensus. So, instead of providing information, they are deliberately misleading folks&hellip; Often what the majority does is wrong because the majority of people are not the experts.

This book is a comprehensive reference guide to MySQL that&rsquo;s accessible to beginning DBAs or DBAs familiar with another database. It has enough detail to be a useful companion throughout a DBA&rsquo;s career. It also covers many related technologies, such as memcached, at a moderate-but-useful level of detail.

It should be a very useful conference for those in or near management or leadership positions. Email me if you want a $50 discount off the registration, by the way.

        Suppose that you&rsquo;re writing a new Maatkit tool (just a random example, really) and its job is to measure the difference in execution of queries. The simplest metric is execution time.
Now suppose that you&rsquo;re trying to figure out a metric of badness. The query executes in a second on machine 1 and 1000 seconds on machine 2. That&rsquo;s a pretty bad change. How do you quantify this?
Now you&rsquo;ve got a query that executes in 1ms on machine 1, and 10ms on machine 2.

        I&rsquo;m using Google Docs for a project I&rsquo;m working on right now, and I ran into a problem with spacing. There appears to be no way to get spacing between paragraphs. You can control spacing between lines, but that&rsquo;s not the same thing. Actually, it&rsquo;s quite easy. You just have to know how Google Docs works.
The root problem is that it&rsquo;s not creating paragraphs when you press the [Enter] key.

        Last weekend, my brother and I attended SELF 2009. A few thoughts on it:
The mixture of sessions was interesting. There were some really good ones. I think the best session I attended was an OpenSolaris/NetBeans/Glassfish/Virtualbox/ZFS session, given by a Sun employee. He was an excellent presenter, and really showed off the strengths of the technologies in a nice way. He started up enough VMs to make his OpenSolaris laptop chew into swap, and I thought it was fun to see how it dealt with that.

        Just thought it was worth pointing out that Percona Xtrabackup is not just for XtraDB. It works great for InnoDB tables, too.
So if mysqldump can&rsquo;t handle it anymore, LVM snapshots kill your server and you don&rsquo;t want to buy proprietary backup software, you might take a look at Xtrabackup.

        In the last six months, things have gotten much busier in the world of MySQL performance. That is, making MySQL and InnoDB scale faster out of the box. This is a great trend and I hope it keeps going. At this point I&rsquo;m fighting to find enough time to read about what people are doing; I can&rsquo;t keep up fast enough to actually understand the improvements. That&rsquo;s also good.
The blogs that are posting the most news and analysis are MySQL Performance Blog, Mikael Ronstrom&rsquo;s blog, DimitriK&rsquo;s blog, and Mark Callaghan&rsquo;s blog.

        As you can probably guess, I&rsquo;m catching up on reading my blogs. I&rsquo;ve just read with interest about TokuDB&rsquo;s multiple clustering indexes. It&rsquo;s kind of an obvious thought, once someone has pointed it out to you. I&rsquo;ve only been around products that insist there can be Only One clustered index (and then there&rsquo;s ScaleDB, who say &ldquo;think differently already&rdquo;).
Anyway, we already know that there are quite a few database products that use clustered indexes and to avoid update overhead, require every non-clustered index to store the clustered key as the &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; for row lookups.

        Tokutek have said they are working towards explaining their indexing algorithms.

While Vadim, Peter and I were writing our blog post on TokuDB, I asked them to provide scholarly references, and they did, but warned me it would be dense reading, in part because it&rsquo;s so academic.

I have no clue when it&rsquo;ll be done. There is no schedule. At the current rate, it&rsquo;ll take a while.
