        <span class="post-date">Tue, Apr 10, 2012</span>
        Oracle has released another huge batch of improvements to MySQL slated for MySQL 5.6. The pace of innovation in MySQL is accelerating rapidly and the improvements are impressive. I have not read all of the blog posts thoroughly yet, but I&rsquo;ve skimmed and it looks fantastic.
The link posted above is ONE of the sets of improvements: there are also a bunch of other posts about new improvements to the query optimizer, InnoDB, and probably more.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 9, 2012</span>
        MySQL became wildly successful in part because it had built-in, simple replication. Sure, it had lots of interesting failure scenarios and was not great at first &mdash; it is much better these days &mdash; but it was nevertheless successful because there was a single, out-of-the-box, not-very-complex way to do replication. I have opined many times before that this was one of the killer features missing from PostgreSQL. I think that can large explain why MySQL became more popular more quickly.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Apr 8, 2012</span>
        In case you live under a rock, the MySQL conference starts on Tuesday. There are 8 concurrent tracks of content. Aside from my own talks, here are the sessions I would most like to see.
On Tuesday:
 Tutorial: Innodb and XtraDB Architecture and Performance Optimization. Peter&rsquo;s talks are always great, and this is a perennial favorite. If you have never been, you should go to this one. You will realize how little you really know about InnoDB/XtraDB, and how much it matters.

        Clojure In Action  Clojure In Action, by Amit Rathore. Manning, 2012. About 400 pages.
This is a lucid and interesting introduction to Clojure and the LISP family of programming languages. It&rsquo;s been years since I programmed in LISP and I found myself recalling those days, at the same time as I learned a lot more than I used to know. Indeed, I realized that my knowledge of LISP was only superficial, and that I probably ought to take some time at some point and learn it deeply enough to have the epiphany people talk about.

        <p>I&rsquo;ve been a consultant for over five years now and I&rsquo;m just beginning to learn some basic things. One of them is how to spot a lose-lose customer relationship.

        Note: This post was an April Fool&rsquo;s Joke. I was not actually working on a 4th edition. As of 2016, there&rsquo;s no project to create a 4th edition yet.
With the 3rd edition of High Performance MySQL finally complete, I&rsquo;ve begun work on the 4th edition. As you know, technology moves much faster than printing presses, and a book is outdated very quickly, so this is a never-ending project. I&rsquo;m also outlining the 5th edition in anticipation of starting it immediately afterwards.

        O&rsquo;Reilly authors get 10 copies of their own books for free, and my copies of the third edition of High Performance MySQL arrived yesterday. Now it&rsquo;s official! It feels nice to actually hold it in my hand.
A few people have asked me about messages from Amazon saying that their ship date has changed. I don&rsquo;t know anything about that; maybe Amazon just made a wild guess the first time and now they actually know something more realistic.

        Here&rsquo;s your spammy day-of reminder about tonight&rsquo;s free MySQL meetup. The topic is MySQL Monitoring Bonanza. There will be beer, pizza, pretty charts and graphs, and friends. Free as in beer (and pizza, did I mention that?)!
 Note: VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production. VividCortex offers MySQL performance monitoring and PostgreSQL performance management among many other features.

        If you follow what Percona is up to, you might have noticed that I&rsquo;ve created a set of high-quality monitoring and graphing plugins for MySQL and related systems. Currently they support Nagios and Cacti. I&rsquo;ll give a free webinar on March 28th discussing these, and more broadly, discussing how to monitor MySQL successfully to avoid common problems like spammy alerts about nonexistent problems.
 VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012.

        My earlier blog post was wrong, our block of rooms for the conference is still available past the 12th of March. However, there are apparently zero rooms available in the Hyatt other than our reserved block, and our block discount will expire soon (I&rsquo;m a little hazy on the exact details, because I thought it was the 12th). What I have been told in no uncertain terms is this: &ldquo;If you know anyone who plans to attend the conference and needs a hotel room, they should book IMMEDIATELY in our room block or they will not be able to get a room in the Hyatt either at a reasonable rate or at all.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Mar 13, 2012</span>
        Do you know why relational databases are called relational? I commonly see explanations such as this:
 an RDBMS is called a relational database system because the data is stored in tables.
 There, now that&rsquo;s all cleared up! Or not.
The most common explanation or reason I hear cited for the name is that it&rsquo;s because of relationships between data. But this isn&rsquo;t really accurate.
The real reason is because of something called relational algebra, which takes its name from a mathematical construct called a relation.

Why is this a big deal? Why the hard deadline? It turns out that this is one of the things I always underestimated. Planning for these is actually quite difficult and they are very expensive.

 Familiar, comfortable tools and techniques, or capabilities of the Oracle Database, that you miss in MySQL Equivalents or replacements for the aforementioned  Do you have anything to share with your fellow DBAs going through ODT (Oracle Delerium Tremens)?
