        <span class="post-date">Fri, Feb 6, 2009</span>
        So far this year I&rsquo;ve been totally silent about the MySQL Conference and Expo 2009. In the past I&rsquo;ve been a vocal advocate of going to the conference and sending your employees to the conference. So my silence was conspicuous to me, if not to you. I&rsquo;ve always considered myself a strong MySQL supporter and I still do.
Why wasn&rsquo;t I telling people to go to this year&rsquo;s conference? Simple: I can&rsquo;t in good conscience tell people to attend an event from which I&rsquo;ve been excluded (oh, the irony).

        Our Percona Performance Conference is making the rounds on Digg. Is it bad form to ask for people to vote for it? &hellip;. ok then I won&rsquo;t.
But I assume it&rsquo;s okay for me to suggest that perconaperfconf09 is a reasonable tag to use for this event.

        We (Percona) just announced our Percona Performance Conference, and I wanted to tell you a little more about what we hope to accomplish with this conference. Let me show you some simple math that anyone can do.
There&rsquo;s a handy iCal download of the conference schedule on the conference website. iCal is a plain text format that is easy to parse with a scripting language. I downloaded this year&rsquo;s and last year&rsquo;s schedules, and aggregated the number of times each company and speaker is listed as presenting a session.

        I&rsquo;ve been going through some old stuff that got thrown into a big cardboard box during my move in September. In particular there are a lot of papers from my desk &ndash; old notes I&rsquo;d scratched down, legal pads full of notes taken during phone conversations, and so on.
Reading through these old conversations brings them back to me. There are notes from my first &ldquo;non-interview&rdquo; with Alan Rimm-Kaufman of The Rimm-Kaufman Group.

        Our monthly Maatkit release is ready to download, on time as we&rsquo;ve gotten into the habit of doing every month. There have been a LOT of changes. One thing to note: mk-log-parser is now renamed as mk-query-digest. There is too much else to write about, and things are in very rapid flux. Just read the documentation!
If you don&rsquo;t see your bug fixed or feature request implemented below, now&rsquo;s a great time to sponsor the features you need.

        Thunderbird&rsquo;s email search isn&rsquo;t that great by today&rsquo;s standards. If I type &ldquo;red dog&rdquo; into the search bar it doesn&rsquo;t even tokenize and search for the words separately &ndash; it&rsquo;s a substring match so &ldquo;my dog is red&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t found. And it&rsquo;s slow.
What about embedding &ldquo;real&rdquo; fulltext search into it? Sphinx perhaps?
Just a thought.

        Most software changelogs list what&rsquo;s changed and what bugs are fixed during each upgrade. But when you&rsquo;re evaluating an upgrade, what you&rsquo;re typically concerned about is slightly different &ndash; it&rsquo;s a combination of what&rsquo;s changed and what might have broken. The fixed bugs aren&rsquo;t as important for most people, who are either using a workaround or aren&rsquo;t using the software. What people ask is &ldquo;what do I have to change in my application, and/or make sure I&rsquo;m not going to run afoul of, in order to use this new version?

        As Hubert writes, PostgreSQL 8.4 has windowing functions.
Well done. I&rsquo;ve been watching progress on this for a while. It greatly enhances the expressiveness of SQL.
What about common table expressions (WITH and WITH RECURSIVE)? Yes, PostgreSQL 8.4 will have common table expressions (WITH and WITH RECURSIVE) as well. That&rsquo;s the &ldquo;other&rdquo; quantum leap in the expressiveness of SQL in my mind.
Meanwhile I&rsquo;m helping a client rewrite subqueries and finding bugs in MySQL&rsquo;s subquery handling that cause equivalent expressions to return different results.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 20, 2009</span>
        I was just talking to someone who backs up their MySQL servers once a day with mysqldump, and I said in a catastrophe, you&rsquo;re going to have to reload from a backup; that&rsquo;s some amount of downtime, plus up to a day of lost data.
And they said &ldquo;We can just promote a replica, we&rsquo;ve done it before. It works fine.&rdquo;
Granted, in some/many cases, this is fine. There are all sorts of caveats &ndash; for example, you either know that your slave has the same data as the master or you don&rsquo;t care.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 13, 2009</span>
        A while back a Sun engineer posted an article claiming that the best way to scale MySQL is to shard your database in many instances on a single server, each of which runs in threads that individually have low performance. The Sun way has always been to get high throughput with high latency. And that&rsquo;s fine. Others have commented on the real-world applicability of this technique with MySQL, so I won&rsquo;t.

 20:13, 10 July 2008 Djsasso (Talk | contribs) deleted &ldquo;Maatkit&rdquo; â€Ž (WP:PROD, reason was &lsquo;Non-notable application, single primary source&rsquo;.)
 I have never been a very big promoter. I prefer to let people promote things themselves, and I try for a policy of attraction rather than promotion myself.
With that said, I often hear people saying some variant of &ldquo;Maatkit saved my behind, thanks so much.

        Mark Wong&rsquo;s entry titled &ldquo;Following up a couple questions from the presentation at PSU on January 8, 2009&rdquo; just caught my eye:
 What is &lsquo;iopp&rsquo;?
It&rsquo;s a custom tool to go through the Linux process table to get i/o statistics per process. It is open source and can be downloaded from:
http://git.postgresql.org/?p=~markwkm/iopp.git;a=summary
 If you know me, you know I can&rsquo;t pass up &ldquo;I/O statistics per process.&rdquo; No way. So, after a moment of browsing the code, which is short and to the point, I tried it out:

        This is actually old news, but I never thought to file a bug report (until now) or say anything to anyone about it. If you use mysqldump to dump and restore a MySQL table that has INSERT triggers, you can get different data in your restored database than you had when you dumped. The problem? The tool dumps the triggers before the data, so they get added back to the table before the rows are inserted.

I first read this essay at my father&rsquo;s suggestion, long before I was involved with computers. He told me it was the best defense of free enterprise and free markets that he&rsquo;d ever read.

        This post is for people who are trying to roll back unwanted modifications to their MySQL database.
You cannot use the binary logs to undo unwanted changes to your data. The binary logs are for redoing statements, not undoing them. If you have a backup, you may be able to restore the backup and then replay binary logs to roll forward to the desired state. But you cannot roll backwards with the binary logs.

Daniel and I have been working hard on it all month, adding killer new features like &#8211;review, fixing tons of bugs, and making it twice as fast. I believe it&rsquo;s far and away the best slow-log analysis tool in existence, both in terms of functionality and quality. (Do any of the other tools even have test suites&hellip;?

        I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the business of what&rsquo;s variously come to be called commercial open-source and enterprise open-source. I&rsquo;m interested in the gestalt &ndash; the product, development processes, marketing, licensing and so on.
MySQL has tried many different ways to earn money. These include dual licensing, support subscriptions, a knowledgebase, consulting, an Enterprise/Community split, trying to make parts of the server closed-source, making tools in a split community/premium version, building functionality externally in closed-source software where they can charge for it, and most recently creating three tiers of functionality for the MySQL 5.

There is virtually no risk of doing this, and in fact, the risk of not doing so is quite material. Upgrading the database later would be silly when you could start using it now and find out how best to work with it. Notice that the single criterion I&rsquo;m mentioning is risk, not features.

My question is what happens in the other 3 scenarios that weren&rsquo;t measured? Namely,
 Test#4: buffered I/O and 20GB of shared_buffers Test#5: direct I/O and 500MB of shared_buffers Test#6: direct I/O and 2GB of shared_buffers  Without these, I&rsquo;m unable to form an opinion on the article&rsquo;s conclusions:
