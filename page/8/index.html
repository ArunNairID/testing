        I was discussing how to avoid surprising users and someone pointed out that what seems intuitive and rational to one person is often complete insanity for others. The mental gap between a developer and a user can often be a chasm far too wide to cross. Of all the bug reports I&rsquo;ve filed against MySQL, here is my all-time favorite:

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Feb 24, 2013</span>
        Most of the time, when people say &ldquo;scalability&rdquo; they mean any of dozens of things. Most of the time, when I say it I mean exactly one precisely defined thing. However, I don&rsquo;t claim that&rsquo;s the only correct use of &ldquo;scalability.&rdquo; There is another, in particular, that I think is very important to understand: the inherent limitations of the system. This second one doesn&rsquo;t have a single mathematical definition, but it&rsquo;s vital nonetheless.

        I&rsquo;m not using my previous combination of Bad Behaviour + WP-Gatekeeper anymore. I&rsquo;ve removed them in favor of ordinary reCAPTCHA. Although it lets a lot of spammers through (almost a thousand spam comments in the day I&rsquo;ve had it enabled) and Bad Behaviour let only 1 or 2 a month through, it became clear that a lot of people were getting blocked wrongly by Bad Behaviour.
This means that I can&rsquo;t practically moderate the spam queue.

        Sublime Text 2 is really nice, but the documentation is truly awful. There are at least 3 versions of it, all of them wrong and incomplete. This blog post shows how I set up a Go build system.
I am using GoSublime, but that is completely independent of the build system. The goal of GoSublime is nice auto-completion and snippets and so on; the build system is just supposed to invoke a command with Control-B (or Command-B), capture the output, and recognize file/line in the output so you can navigate between build errors easily.

        I&rsquo;m really looking forward to this year&rsquo;s Percona Live MySQL Conference. This is always THE event of the year for me in the MySQL conference circuit. It&rsquo;s also the first year I haven&rsquo;t been a speaker! I&rsquo;ve been a speaker since 2007 but this year things were too uncertain for me to submit a proposal in time.
As usual, the real highlight of the conference is seeing and talking to everyone.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Feb 3, 2013</span>
        I wonder if the MySQL archaeologists out there would be willing to unearth some (presumably ancient) history for me. Why does the logging configuration merit special mention in the version_comment variable?
The more I think about this, the more bizarre it seems. I enabled logging. The version reported by the server changed. No, really, is my server somehow a different version of MySQL now?

        SQL is such a bizarre language. It is all backwards. Consider:
SELECT item_id, COUNT(*) AS qty, SUM(qty * price) AS total FROM line_item WHERE invoice_id = 18743 GROUP BY item_id HAVING SUM(discount) &gt; 0 ORDER BY item_id;  What is the logical flow of this statement? If SQL were written in logical-flow order, it might look something like this:
FROM line_item WHERE invoice_id = 18743 RETRIEVE item_id, qty, price, discount GROUP BY item_id COMPUTE item_id, COUNT(*) AS qty, SUM(qty * price) AS total, SUM(discount) HAVING SUM(discount) &gt; 0 PROJECT item_id, qty, total ORDER BY item_id;  SQL can get really hard to read and understand, really fast.

        I have often seen people fitting curves to sets of data without first understanding whether that is appropriate. I once even used this blog to criticize someone for doing that.
I was trying to explain that it&rsquo;s wrong to fit a model to a set of measurements, unless the model actually describes the process that produced the measurements.
All of my explanations (and rants) have fallen far short of the clarity and simplicity of this curve-fitting guide.

        I wrote pt-archiver for jobs like deleting or archiving rows from a big table in small chunks. These days, that&rsquo;s the kind of task I like doing inside the database, and Shlomi&rsquo;s magical common_schema feels a lot more suited for this than an external Perl script.
When I say it&rsquo;s magical, it really does feel magical. It&rsquo;s amazing how he&rsquo;s created an entire expressive scripting language that runs in MySQL and feels just right for the job.

        I&rsquo;m reading a little bit about Riak, and was curious about performance and scalability. The only benchmark I found that allowed me to assess scalability was this one from Joyent. Of course, they say scalability is linear (everyone says that without knowing what it means) but the results are clearly not a straight line. So how scalable is it, really?
The Universal Scalability Law is such a powerful tool for thinking about scalability.

        I enjoyed being able to add metadata to a connection in Microsoft SQL Server. I&rsquo;d annotate my connections so that a DBA could learn a little bit by inspecting it. For example, what was its purpose, and from which application did it originate? The employer where I did this wasn&rsquo;t perfect at managing their database user accounts and so forth, and there were many servers with hundreds of databases on each server, so this was a good way to provide some extra hints.

        In case you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock for the last 5 years, the NoSQL movement has changed. There was a time when everyone &ndash; EVERYONE &ndash; was dumping on relational databases, and MySQL in particular. Nonsense like &ldquo;SQL itself is inherently unscalable&rdquo; routinely came out of the mouths of otherwise usually sensible people. But that&rsquo;s cooled off a little bit, thank heavens.
And what&rsquo;s the new hotness? Well, Big Data, of course!

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Jan 7, 2013</span>
        I&rsquo;ve written a lot about modeling MySQL with the USL, and I like it best of all the scalability models I&rsquo;ve seen, but it&rsquo;s not the only way to think about scalability. I was aware that New Relic supports a scalability chart, so I decided to take a peek at that. Here&rsquo;s a screenshot of the chart, from their blog:
Here&rsquo;s how it works. It plots response time (or database time, or CPU) as the dependent variable, versus throughput as the independent variable.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 5, 2013</span>
        Last time I said that you can set a starting value for the USL&rsquo;s coefficient of performance and let your modeling software (R, gnuplot, etc) manipulate this as part of the regression to find the best fit. However, there is a subtlety in the USL model that you need to be aware of. Here is a picture of the low-end of the curve:
The graph shows the USL model as the blue curve and linear scalability as the black line.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Jan 3, 2013</span>
        Last time I said that the USL has a forgotten third coefficient, the coefficient of performance. This is the same thing as the system&rsquo;s throughput at concurrency=1, or C(1). How do you determine this coefficient? There are at least three ways.
Neil Gunther&rsquo;s writings, or at least those that I&rsquo;ve read and remember, say that you should set it equal to your measurement of C(1). Most of his writing discusses a handful of measurements of the system: one at concurrency 1, and at least 4 to 6 at higher concurrencies.

        If you&rsquo;re familiar with Neil Gunther&rsquo;s Universal Scalability Law, you may have heard it said that there are two coefficients, variously called alpha and beta or sigma and kappa. There are actually three coefficients, though. See?
\[ C(N) = \frac{N}{1 + \sigma(N-1) + \kappa N (N-1)} \]
No, you don&rsquo;t see it &ndash; but it&rsquo;s actually there, as a hidden 1 multiplied by N in the numerator on the right-hand side.

        Moral of the upcoming story: when your systems rely on someone else&rsquo;s software, make sure you test it thoroughly to understand how it works.
I found a couple of interesting things about the go-mysql-driver driver for Go. One is that it prepares every query before executing it, and then closes it afterwards, if you&rsquo;re just using the db.Query() or db.QueryRow() functionality. There is zero benefit to this; Bill Karwin has probably listed it as an antipattern somewhere.

        Those who&rsquo;ve been around the MySQL world are probably aware of the much-discussed topics of GPL licensing, dual licensing, and in particular, licensing of the client libraries (also called connectors or drivers) and the FOSS exception to that licensing. This is newly relevant with the announcement of a permissively-licensed MySQL-compatible client library for MariaDB.
The difference is that this time there&rsquo;s been some question about the provenance and history of the source code.

        I was just bitten by failing to catch a MySQL warning. It&rsquo;s the old familiar tune: I inserted 100 characters into a VARCHAR(50) and it didn&rsquo;t throw an error*. Of course, then subsequent SELECT statements didn&rsquo;t find the value I inserted.
What&rsquo;s different this time is that I was using Go as the client. There is no single official MySQL driver for Go, although there are several good-quality community-maintained ones. I was using one of those through the official Go database interface, which is a simple and lightweight way to interact with relational databases.

She&rsquo;s held top-level technical roles at some large and extremely respectable companies. In short, her perspective and experience is very valuable.
One of my most important questions was what technologies she saw as established or emerging winners &ndash; good technologies to use as the foundation for a startup.
