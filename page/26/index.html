        I am speaking at Enterprise LAMP Summit 2009 (and also should be speaking at the Camp the next day, but I see the schedule isn&rsquo;t quite updated yet). My talk at the Summit will not be on the future landscape of MySQL &ndash; that&rsquo;s a mistake. My talk&rsquo;s title isn&rsquo;t finalized yet.
This conference is the first weekend in November, in the Nashville area. I hope to see you there!

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Sep 29, 2009</span>
        I&rsquo;ve been investigating a few different storage engines for MySQL lately, and something I&rsquo;ve noticed is that they all list what they support, but they generally don&rsquo;t say what they don&rsquo;t support. For example, Infobright&rsquo;s documentation shows a list of every data type supported. What&rsquo;s missing? Hmm, I don&rsquo;t see BLOB, BIT, ENUM, SET&hellip; it&rsquo;s kind of hard to tell. The same thing is true of the list of functions that are optimized inside Infobright&rsquo;s own code instead of at the server layer.

Pseudo-three-dimensional charts are the bane of my existence. Tufte would definitely not approve. (If you don&rsquo;t have The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, you should really get it and give it a read.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Sep 27, 2009</span>
        <p>Since I joined Percona, my work/life balance has changed. I used to work eight-hour days and go home, period. Now I find it&rsquo;s sometimes difficult to keep good boundaries between work and the rest of my life. I also found that 8 hours in my new job left me much more tired than 8 in my old job. I&rsquo;ve had to really work hard to understand what changed and how to keep this more in balance.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2009/09/newtons-cradle.jpg" alt="Newton's Cradle" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gotten help from a number of other people. In the end, a deep examination of my habits was necessary. After all that work, I thought it might be helpful to share the results with others.</p>

        Key-value databases are catching fire these days. Memcached, Redis, Cassandra, Keyspace, Tokyo Tyrant, and a handful of others are surging in popularity, judging by the contents of my feed reader.
I find a number of things interesting about these tools.
 There are many more of them than open-source traditional relational databases. (edit: I mean that there are many options that all seem similar to each other, instead of 3 or 4 standing out as the giants.

        I used to develop with MySQL, and those were the golden days. These days I don&rsquo;t write queries so much. But yesterday I needed to answer this question: are there any issues in our issue-tracking system that meet the following criteria?
 The last two or more emails are from the customer These emails were separated by at least two hours (i.e. it wasn&rsquo;t a single train of thought)  I could do it with all kinds of correlated subqueries and so on &ndash; but maybe I could also just do it without them, no?

        Spammers seem to have gotten smarter recently, and able to post garbage to Google Groups. There was some spam on a couple of the groups I&rsquo;ve created, and members helped me find a way to stop it. I&rsquo;m glad they did, because since then it&rsquo;s stopped an increasing flow of spam. I just deleted and banned a whole bunch of emails titled &ldquo;answer group&rdquo; across different groups, and I see the same crud got through to a group I&rsquo;m on but don&rsquo;t own.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Sep 12, 2009</span>
        There&rsquo;s a really important difference between a unique index (MySQL&rsquo;s answer to a &ldquo;unique constraint&rdquo;) and a primary key in MySQL. Please take a look at this:
CREATE TABLE `t` ( `a` int, `b` int, `c` int, UNIQUE KEY `a` (`a`,`b`) ) The combination of columns a, b should uniquely identify any tuple in the table, right?
select * from t; +------+------+------+ | a | b | c | +------+------+------+ | 1 | 2 | 3 | | NULL | NULL | 1 | | NULL | NULL | 1 | | NULL | NULL | 1 | +------+------+------+  Wrong.

Mutex spin waits 0, rounds 143359179688, OS waits 634106844 RW-shared spins 1224152309, OS waits 38278807; RW-excl spins 2432166425, OS waits 35264871 Mutex spin waits 0, rounds 143386303439, OS waits 634292093 RW-shared spins 1224197048, OS waits 38281423; RW-excl spins 2432347936, OS waits 35271423 How much have the numbers changed in the second sample?

A short time ago in a galaxy nearby, Domas Mituzas wrote about contention profiling with GDB stack traces. Mark Callaghan found the technique useful, and contributed an awk script (in the comments) to aggregate stack traces and identify which things are blocking most threads. I&rsquo;ve used it myself a time or five.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Aug 30, 2009</span>
        I&rsquo;ve been thinking recently about the failure scenarios of MySQL replication clusters, such as master-master pairs or master-master-with-slaves. There are a few tools that are designed to help manage failover and load balancing in such clusters, by moving virtual IP addresses around. The ones I&rsquo;m familiar with don&rsquo;t always do the right thing when an irregularity is detected. I&rsquo;ve been debating what the best way to do replication clustering with automatic failover really is.

        Newer Linux kernels have per-process I/O accounting and you can use the iotop tool to find out what&rsquo;s performing I/O, but in many cases I&rsquo;m trying to find the source of an I/O problem in an older kernel. I found sort of a hack-ish way to do that today, while trying to figure out why a system was basically unresponsive.
I found a post on Stack Overflow that showed a way you can get per process I/O statistics from the kernel even in older kernels.

My wife bought a copy of this book, and recently I took it off her bookshelf to give it a read myself.
I found the book very lucid and readable. The author does not drag us through a bunch of formalisms, nor does she attempt to force the book to be readable through the use of comics, pop-culture references, or other artificial devices.

        You probably know that it&rsquo;s possible to set configuration variables to log queries that don&rsquo;t use indexes to the slow query log in MySQL. This is a good way to find tables that might need indexes.
But what if the slow query log isn&rsquo;t enabled and you are using (or consulting on) MySQL 5.0 or earlier, where it can&rsquo;t be enabled on the fly unless you&rsquo;re using a patched server such as Percona&rsquo;s enhanced builds?

So far I&rsquo;m delighted. I&rsquo;m 6-foot-4 (195cm) and this is one of the only chairs I&rsquo;ve ever seen that seats my height comfortably, both in terms of seat height and in terms of being tall enough to relax back into (the headrest extends up high enough to support my head and neck nicely).

        Do you test your application systematically when you upgrade or reconfigure your database server? You should! Here&rsquo;s a real (anonymized) story of what happens if you don&rsquo;t.
 When we upgraded to 5.0.62 (from 5.0.27 and 5.0.45), our code broke for queries like this:
SELECT SUM(amt) FROM daily_amt WHERE day = FROM_UNIXTIME(1222889772);
The problem here was a wrong DATE/DATETIME comparison and other bug fixes in MySQL 5.0.62; it was stricter in enforcing the comparison.
