        <span class="post-date">Sun, Sep 19, 2010</span>
        Here&rsquo;s a little trivia that you might find helpful. Suppose that I have the following in the MySQL slow query log (abbreviated for clarity):
 # User@Host: root[root] @ localhost [127.0.0.1] # Time: 100919 17:58:52 # Query_time: 9.648427 Lock_time: 8.648039 select sleep(1) from t limit 1;  To get this into the slow query log, I set the long_query_time to 0 and opened two sessions. In one session I ran LOCK TABLES t WRITE, and in the other I tried to select from that table.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Sep 15, 2010</span>
        The newest release of Percona Server includes a trivial change that I think will be extremely valuable. This is the addition of a new thread state, &ldquo;Waiting on query cache mutex.&rdquo; Fixing the query cache to make it scalable is hard. Fixing the server to report when the query cache is a bottleneck is not hard. It has historically been very difficult for users to diagnose what&rsquo;s wrong with their server when the query cache is locking it intermittently.

        I just realized that I didn&rsquo;t publicize this in the Postgres world, or anywhere but the MySQL blogosphere for that matter. Some folks at my company have released a generic TCP-response-time tool. Very useful for monitoring, benchmarks, historical metrics, and so on. It&rsquo;s kind of like iostat, but for TCP traffic, and fully focused on time, not traffic size. Performance == time and tasks, and this is a lightweight way to measure that data.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Sep 7, 2010</span>
        CouchDB is a document-oriented database written in Erlang that addresses a particular &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; in data storage and retrieval needs. This blog post is an introduction to CouchDB for those of us who have a relational database background.
A CouchDB database doesn&rsquo;t have tables. It has a collection of documents, stored in a B+Tree. A document is a collection of attributes and values. Values can be atomic, or complex nested structures such as arrays and sub-documents.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Sep 6, 2010</span>
        I&rsquo;ve been studying the source of iostat again and trying to understand whether all of its calculations I explained here are valid and correct. Two of the columns did not seem consistent to me. The await and svctm columns are supposed to measure the average time from beginning to end of requests including device queueing, and actual time to service the request on the device, respectively. But there&rsquo;s really no instrumentation to support that distinction.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Sep 4, 2010</span>
        You have a backup, and you have the binary logs between that backup and now. You need to do point-in-time recovery (PITR) for some reason. What do you do? The traditional answer is &ldquo;restore the backup and then use mysqlbinlog to apply the binary logs.&rdquo; But there&rsquo;s a much better way to do it.
The better way is to set up a server instance with no data, and load the binary logs into it.

        ODTUG invited me to give a webinar and I said yes, so this Thursday you&rsquo;re invited to join me as I talk about MySQL performance. We&rsquo;ve come a very long way towards a MySQL that can perform well on modern hardware, and there really isn&rsquo;t broad recognition of this. A lot of the best work has gone into the InnoDB &ldquo;plugin&rdquo; storage engine, which was announced after my co-authors and I sent High Performance MySQL to the press.

        Bug reports can be fun. They can also be terrible. Either way they can be entertaining. On the Drizzle IRC channel today I saw a couple references to MySQL bug reports: it is stop working and Does not make toast (which reminds me of the Mozilla bug report about the kitchen sink). Got any other favourites1?
1 This one&rsquo;s for Jay.

        I&rsquo;ve noticed that a steady and perhaps even growing number of bug reports and feature requests are getting resolved for the next milestone release. I continue to see signs that Oracle&rsquo;s next release of MySQL will not only include much of the unreleased good work that&rsquo;s been done over the last few years, but will add a lot of new features and fixes as well.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Aug 2, 2010</span>
        OUTER JOIN queries in SQL are susceptible to two very subtle bugs that I&rsquo;ve observed a number of times in the real world. Daniel and I have been hammering out ways to automatically detect queries that suffer from these bugs, in a relatively new Maatkit tool called mk-query-advisor. It&rsquo;s part of our series of advisor tools for MySQL. I wrote a blog post about it a while ago. Automated analysis of bad query patterns is a good thing to write tools to do, because catching buggy queries is hard work if you do it manually.

I got in touch with the organizer and we scheduled a meeting next Wednesday July 28th. I&rsquo;ll be presenting, and so will someone from Fusion-IO, a solid-state storage vendor. This is on short notice, so tell your friends about it! It would be great to grow a strong monthly meetup presence in this area.

This is a great book on how to build apps in the cloud! I was happy to see how much depth it went into. It&rsquo;s short &ndash; 150 pages plus some appendixes &ndash; so I was expecting it to be a superficial overview. But it isn&rsquo;t. It is thorough. And it is also obviously built on his own experience building very specific applications that he uses to run his business &ndash; he isn&rsquo;t preaching about stuff he doesn&rsquo;t know first-hand.

        This is the follow-up to my post on how I keep track of tasks. It&rsquo;s important for me to have a good system for keeping notes and other files organized. The problem usually turns out to be that I want them organized several different ways simultaneously: by date, by project, by person, by subject. Alas, if I keep them in files on a hard drive, I can only choose one such organizing strategy, because filesystems are a single hierarchy.

        There&rsquo;s lots of buzz lately about the so-called &ldquo;open-core&rdquo; business model of Marten Mickos&rsquo;s new employer. But this is nothing new. Depending on how you define it, InnoDB is &ldquo;open-core,&rdquo; and has been for a long time. The InnoDB Hot Backup (ibbackup) tool was always closed-source. Did anyone ever cry foul and claim that this made InnoDB itself not open-source, or accuse Innobase / Oracle of masquerading as open-source? I don&rsquo;t recall that happening, although sometimes people got suspicious about the interplay between the backup tool and the storage engine.
