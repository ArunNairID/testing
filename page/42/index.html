        <span class="post-date">Sun, Jul 15, 2007</span>
        I&rsquo;ve updated my JavaScript Number Formatting Library to version 1.3. This release adds the ability to customize how not-a-number (NaN), positive infinity and negative infinity are formatted. All you need to do is set the appropriate constant in Number.prototype:
 Number.prototype.NaN Number.prototype.posInfinity Number.prototype.negInfinity  For more documentation, see the original article on JavaScript number formatting.

        Version 1.4.3 of the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor is out. This release fixes some minor bugs and feature annoyances, and at last innotop has thorough documentation, available online!
What&rsquo;s new Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new:
 Added standard &#8211;version command-line option Changed colors to cyan instead of blue; more visible on dark terminals. Added information to the filter-choosing dialog. Added column auto-completion when entering a filter expression. Changed Term::ReadKey from optional to mandatory.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jul 10, 2007</span>
        This release fixes some bugs and improves the chunking functionality. MySQL Table Checksum had a few minor bugs and one major bug with the chunking functionality. I also rewrote the chunking, though the behavior is backwards compatible. I am very happy with the way it works now, and will probably not make any more incompatible changes to it. The changes enabled me to add support for chunking on float, double and decimal columns.

        I haven&rsquo;t been blogging about the things I used to &ndash; how-tos and technical hacks &ndash; because I&rsquo;ve been working quite hard on MySQL Toolkit and, believe it or not, innotop. I&rsquo;ve made it possible to write innotop plugins, which have been very useful to our team at work, and I&rsquo;m working on documentation. Plugins won&rsquo;t make it into the upcoming release; it&rsquo;ll just be bug fixes and documentation. These projects have taken up most of my free time.

        MySQL Toolkit distribution 620 updates documentation and test suites, includes some major bug fixes and functionality changes, and adds one new tool to the toolkit. This article is mostly a changelog, with some added notes.
Many of the tools have matured and I just needed to make the documentation top-notch, but there&rsquo;s still a lot to be done on the crucial checksumming and syncing tools. Time is in short supply for me right now, though.

        This is a quick update on the state of my JavaScript date formatting libraries and date chooser, and JavaScript number formatting library. It&rsquo;s been a while since I wrote them, and as you can tell my interests have turned to many other things, but thet remain the best JavaScript formatting and parsing libraries I&rsquo;ve seen.
I originally started this post in May of 2006, intending to use the libraries to demonstrate how HTML tables can contain multi-dimensional data, and use the seldom-used HTML elements like TFOOT to generate aggregate data about the table.

        I&rsquo;ve released a new version of my powerful, flexible, efficient JavaScript number-formatting library, which is probably the best available. This release adds a fix for zero-padding negative numbers.
If you find bugs, please send me test cases I can use to reproduce and add to the unit test suite. One test per line, like &ldquo;input&rdquo;, &ldquo;format&rdquo;, &ldquo;expected&rdquo; is best. For example, this is a great test case:
-1, "#,#.00", "-1.00" I can plug that directly into the unit test suite, run it, and if it gives back &ldquo;-01.

        Brian Aker was a recent guest on the LinuxCast podcast with Don Marti. Brian has some interesting thoughts in this podcast and elsewhere on his blog, on motivations for writing Free and/or Open Source software. Here&rsquo;s why I do it myself.
First an overview of the podcast, for context: the topics were storage engines, distributed version control, and motivation for open-source. (You should listen to it, if you haven&rsquo;t &ndash; it&rsquo;s short and Brian is a great speaker.

        In the first two articles in this series, I discussed archiving basics, relationships and dependencies, and specific archiving techniques for online transaction processing (OLTP) database servers. This article covers how to move the data from the OLTP source to the archive destination, what the archive destination might look like, and how to un-archive data. If you can un-archive easily and reliably, a whole new world of possibilities opens up.

        In the first article in this series on archiving strategies for online transaction processing (OLTP) database servers, I covered some basics: why to archive, and what to consider when gathering requirements for the archived data itself. This article is more technical. I want to help you understand how to choose which rows are archivable, and how to deal with complex data relationships and dependencies. In that context, I&rsquo;ll also discuss a few concrete archiving strategies, their strengths and shortcomings, and how they can satisfy your requirements, especially requirements for data consistency, which as you will see is one of the most difficult problems in archiving.

        In May 2005, I wrote a widely-referenced article about how to efficiently archive and/or purge data from online transaction processing (OLTP) database servers. That article focused on how to write efficient archiving SQL. In this article I&rsquo;ll discuss archiving strategy, not tactics. OLTP servers tend to have complex schemas, which makes it important and sometimes difficult to design a good archiving strategy.
The 50,000-foot view Archiving is actually a very large topic!

        How good are your SQL and/or general coding skills? I have a specific challenge I&rsquo;d like your help solving. I am not sure it&rsquo;s possible, but I&rsquo;d love to be proven wrong.
I&rsquo;ll explain some background for the problem first, and then pose the challenge at the end of the article.
The problem Several of the algorithms I&rsquo;ve been implementing require data to be partitioned for a divide-and-conquer approach. This is easy enough with numeric and even with temporal data, but character data is more difficult, and I don&rsquo;t have a good strategy yet.

        It&rsquo;s finally here: a single-file download for all the tools in MySQL Toolkit. During this process I also upgraded every package in the toolkit to a new release, combining new versioning and some simple non-functional changes with (mostly minor) changes I&rsquo;d committed but not yet released. Details are at the end of this post.
I ended up not using a Makefile for the build process, because I wanted to it to be more auto-magical than I know how to do with a Makefile.

        This release fixes some minor bugs and adds a plugin mechanism. Now you can extend MySQL Archiver with your own code easily. You could use this to run setup and tear-down, hook code into the archiving process, and more. Possibilities include building summary tables in a data warehouse during archiving, handling dependencies such as foreign keys before archiving each row, or applying advanced logic to determine which rows to archive.

        MySQL Archiver is the implementation of the efficient forward-only archiving and purging strategies I wrote about more than a year ago. It nibbles rows from a table, then inserts them into another table and/or writes them to a file. The object is to do this without interfering with critical online transaction-processing (OLTP) queries.
Several people have asked me to release this code, which I originally wrote for my employer. As it turns out, the delay has been fruitful.

Still, I have limited experience. I want to package all the tools in MySQL Toolkit together and release them in one archive, but I don&rsquo;t know the best way to do it; every idea seems to have drawbacks.
