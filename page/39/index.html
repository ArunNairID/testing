        <span class="post-date">Mon, Nov 26, 2007</span>
        Maatkit (formerly MySQL Toolkit) contains essential command-line utilities for MySQL, such as a table checksum tool and query profiler. It provides missing features such as checking replicas for data consistency, with emphasis on quality and scriptability.
This release fixes several minor bugs. It also renames all the tools to avoid trademark violation, completing the project rename. (Let me know if I missed anything.)

        I am so lucky I married an archaeologist.
Choosing a new name for MySQL Toolkit has been a hassle. I wanted to avoid a literal name, such as, um, MySQL Toolkit. Short is good. And so on, and so on. All the while, the Phoenix/Firebird/Firefox naming debacle was in my thoughts. I only want to do this once.
At first I tried not to stray too much from the current name.

        Maatkit (formerly MySQL Toolkit) has for some time been released both as a bundle, and as individual tools. It&rsquo;s too much work to maintain the individual packages, and I don&rsquo;t think it really benefits anyone much, if at all. While the tools will still be versioned separately, I&rsquo;m going to discontinue releases of the individual packages, and just release the one uber-package from now on.
This will also make it easier for me to manage the name change, but that&rsquo;s just an extra incentive; I&rsquo;ve been considering this for a while.

        This release fixes several bugs introduced in the last release as I replaced untested code with tested code &ndash; how ironic! Actually, I knew that was virtually guaranteed to happen. Anyway, all the bugs you&rsquo;ve helped me find are now fixed. I also fixed a long-standing bug in MySQL Table Sync, which I am otherwise trying to touch as little as possible for the time being.

        It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve written about progress on the book. I actually stopped working on it as much at the beginning of the month, because on October 31st I managed to finish a first draft of the last big chapter (Scaling and High Availability)! Now I&rsquo;m back to full-time work at my employer, and I&rsquo;m working on the book in the evenings and weekends only.
This doesn&rsquo;t mean the book is close to being done, though.

        The 1.5.2 release of innotop contained two bugs, one very minor. The other was a crash because of the new functionality that aggregates results across many connections. I fixed them and released version 1.6.0, which I consider stable and ready for everyone to use. (My version naming convention for innotop is that even-numbered minor versions are for production use; odd-numbered, such as 1.5.2, are the development branch. That&rsquo;s why I release them under the innotop-devel package).

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Nov 8, 2007</span>
        I created MySQL Table Checksum because I was certain replication replicas were slowly drifting out of sync with their masters, and there was no way to prove it. Once I could prove it, I was able to show that replication gets out of sync for lots of people, lots of times. (If you really want to hear war stories, you should probably talk to one of the MySQL support staff or consulting team members; I&rsquo;m sure they see this a lot more than I do).

        Thanks to a patch Dane Miller submitted, MySQL Heartbeat can now be used to monitor Slony-I replication lag for PostgreSQL. It works identically: it updates a record on the master and looks for it on the replica. You just have to specify the database driver on the command-line:
mysql-heartbeat [options] --dbidriver=Pg Most of the tools in the MySQL Toolkit are very MySQL-specific. This one just happened to be an exception, and I&rsquo;m happy it&rsquo;s useful for more than the original purpose.

        Yep, it&rsquo;s true. &ldquo;MySQL Toolkit&rdquo; technically infringes on MySQL&rsquo;s trademark. I haven&rsquo;t been given a mandate or cease-and-desist order or anything, but as Marten Mickos (MySQL&rsquo;s CEO) told me, anything that starts with the word &ldquo;MySQL&rdquo; sounds like it comes from the company, and this project doesn&rsquo;t come from MySQL.
Suggestions are welcome. I&rsquo;m totally uninspired. &ldquo;Toolkit&rdquo; was the best I could do when I named the project to begin with.

        Si Chen wrote recently about the growth limits of open-source projects. He points out that as a project becomes larger, it gets harder to maintain. I can only agree. As the MySQL Toolkit project has grown, it&rsquo;s become significantly more work to maintain, document, and enhance. (This is why I&rsquo;m asking you to sponsor me for a week off my regular job to work on MySQL Table Sync, by the way.

If you&rsquo;ve used plugins with MySQL Archiver you know that I created a series of &ldquo;hooks&rdquo; where plugins can take some action: before beginning, before archiving each row, etc etc. This lets plugins do things like create new destination tables, aggregate archived rows to summary tables during archiving (great for building data warehouses, though not as sophisticated as Kettle), and so on.

        This release fixes some minor bugs. It also adds a few major new features to several of the tools. The command-line option and help functionality, as well as several other pieces of common functionality, has been replaced with common modules that have a test suite. This is the first step towards a gradual rewrite to replace untested &lsquo;script&rsquo; code with tested, maintainable code.

        Last week I wrote about my efforts to measure MySQL&rsquo;s replication speed precisely. The most important ingredient in that recipe was the user-defined function to get the system time with microsecond precision. This post is about that function, which turned out to be surprisingly easy to write.
The manual section on user-defined functions provides very good instructions on how they work and how to build them. But just for the record, on Ubuntu 7.

        Very fast, as it turns out.
While writing the chapter on replication for the upcoming second edition of High Performance MySQL, I decided to do a little test and measure replication speed more accurately than I&rsquo;ve seen others do before. The first edition of the book measured replication speed by inserting on the master and polling on the replica. Giuseppe Maxia later followed up on that by improving the polling process, and found events typically replicated within a half a millisecond.

If you have favorite replication filtering tricks you&rsquo;d like to share, or tasks that always frustrate and/or confuse you, please post them in the comments. I&rsquo;m making a section that shows how to accomplish common filtering and rewriting needs, such as preventing GRANT statements from replicating to the replicas.

Unlike the other chapters for which I&rsquo;ve listed outlines, this one isn&rsquo;t substantially written yet. It&rsquo;s in detailed outline form at this point (a tactic that has worked very well for us so far &ndash; I&rsquo;ll write about that someday).

        The new release of MySQL Toolkit (version 1051) updates MySQL Parallel Dump in minor ways, but more importantly, it adds MySQL Parallel Restore.
MySQL Parallel Restore is the reverse of MySQL Parallel Dump. You give it one or more files and/or directories, and it discovers all the files contained within them and loads them in parallel. It understands how to load SQL and/or TXT/CSV files. If you give it some of both, it loads the SQL first and then loads the TXT/CSV as delimited files with LOAD DATA INFILE.
