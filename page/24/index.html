        Get it Done with MySQL 5&#038;6  Get it Done with MySQL 5&amp;6. By Peter Brawley and Arthur Fuller. Self-published, 2009. Page count: about 615 pages. I asked the authors for a print edition to review, but it is also available as an e-book.
The right word to describe this book falls somewhere between &ldquo;tome&rdquo; and &ldquo;lunker.&rdquo; You could beat back an unwelcome salesperson with it. You could also beat back any number of stubborn database problems.

        I&rsquo;ve released version 1.1.6 of the Better Cacti Templates project. This release includes a bunch of bug fixes (but not all of them!) and two new sets of graphs. One set is for disk I/O on GNU/Linux, and the other is a new set of templates for OpenVZ. I&rsquo;m looking for feedback on both of those. This release also has a bunch of code-level features: much better test coverage (hooray!), and a refactored ss_get_by_ssh.

 Cacti 0.8 Network Monitoring, Dinangkur Kundu and S. M. Ibrahim Lavlu, Packt, 2009. Page count: 110 pages.
This is a quite short book that covers some of the breadth but very little of the depth of Cacti.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 9, 2010</span>
        <p>The <code>iostat</code> tool is one of the most important for measuring disk performance, which of course is very relevant for database administrators, whether your chosen database is Postgres, MySQL, Oracle, or anything else that runs on GNU/Linux. Have you ever wondered where statistics like await (average wait for the request to complete) come from? If you look at the disk statistics the <a href="http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/iostats.txt">Linux kernel makes available through files such as /proc/diskstats</a>, you won&rsquo;t see await there. How does iostat compute await? For that matter, how does it compute the average queue size, service time, and utilization? This blog post will show you how that&rsquo;s computed.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 5, 2010</span>
        This weekend I backed up all my data, repartitioned my hard drive, and re-installed. I needed to do this because the only thing I had on the laptop was Ubuntu, and sadly, the reality is sometimes my clients use things that require me to use Windows (and sometimes a virtual machine won&rsquo;t solve that). So now I&rsquo;m dual-booting Windows. I think the last time I did that was sometime before 2001, so I&rsquo;ve regressed 9 years.

        It&rsquo;s New Year&rsquo;s Eve, a date that should strike terror into the hearts of many, because tomorrow a bunch of their queries are going to fail.
Queries to &ldquo;find all birthdays in the next week&rdquo; and similar are always a nightmare to write. If you want to see a bunch of examples, go look at the user-contributed comments on the MySQL date and time function reference. This post is about a slightly saner way to do that.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Dec 25, 2009</span>
        MySQL has a couple of sanity-check features to help keep you from doing dumb things.
 max_join_size is a configuration option for the mysqld server program. It throws an error if you write a query that the optimizer estimates will examine more than this number of rows. &#8211;safe-updates is a command-line option to the mysql client program. It throws an error if you write an UPDATE or DELETE without a) a WHERE clause that refers to an indexed column or b) a LIMIT clause.

My past experience is that reading 400 session proposals is a mind-numbing job, and I will be optimizing it to save my time. That means I will be scanning your proposals and deciding very quickly how to vote. I wrote before about how to submit a great proposal, but I&rsquo;ve refined my opinion since then.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Dec 14, 2009</span>
        One of MySQL&rsquo;s notable projects was splitting the product into two editions: Enterprise Edition and Community Edition. This move alienated many in the community, and failed to create meaningful differentiation on either side, even with a team of people beating the community bushes for &ldquo;contributions.&rdquo; The net differentiation was ultimately Jeremy Cole&rsquo;s SHOW PROFILES functionality, which made Community better than Enterprise. Sun put less effort into making this split work, and eventually they abandoned it.

        As long as the whole world is chasing this meaningless &ldquo;NoSQL&rdquo; buzzword, we should recognize that InnoDB is usable as an embedded database without an SQL interface. Hence, it is as much of a NoSQL database as anything else labeled with that term. And I might add, it is fast, reliable, and extremely well-tested in the real world. How many NoSQL databases have protection against partial page writes, for example?

One of the bug fixes prevents spikes in graphs, but requires you to rebuild your RRD files. There are upgrade instructions on the project wiki for this and all releases. Use the project issue tracker to view and report issues, and use the project mailing list to discuss the templates and scripts.

 Innobase could therefore have provided an enhanced version of InnoDB, like Oracle&rsquo;s current InnoDB+, under non-GPL license, &hellip;

        The best overall method of performance optimization is optimization for response time. Users care about response time, not load average or cache hit ratios. The job of a system is to accept some request and do the required work, and deliver a result. The time elapsed between the request and the result is the response time.
Methods of Response Time Optimization Not all optimization methods are created equal. Here are a few I see commonly.

        If you haven&rsquo;t seen it, Josh Berkus has a very concise way to look at the confusing mess that is database &ldquo;clustering&rdquo; from the point of view of three distinct types of users: transactional, analytic, and online. I think that using this kind of distinction could help keep discussions clear &ndash; I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of conversations around clustering run off the rails due to disagreements about what clustering means. MySQL Cluster, for example, is a huge red herring for a lot of people, but it seems to be a difficult process to learn it well enough to decide.

 It&rsquo;s not about MySQL versus PostgreSQL, it&rsquo;s about using the right tool for the job.
 Or how about this one?
 You need to take the important factors into account before you decide whether [hot new fad] or [trusty old solution] is best suited for your application.
 Both are signs that someone might be trying to sound important.
