        <span class="post-date">Mon, Jul 4, 2011</span>
        It&rsquo;s notoriously hard to measure the usage of open-source software. Software that&rsquo;s open-source or free can be redistributed far and wide, so the original creators have no idea how many times it&rsquo;s installed, deployed, or distributed. As a proxy, we often use downloads, but that&rsquo;s woefully inadequate.
I&rsquo;ve recently begun trying to figure out how many job openings are mentioning various open-source projects. I think that this might be a better metric because it&rsquo;s driven by the end result (usage), rather than intermediate processes (downloads, etc).

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jun 28, 2011</span>
        tl;dr version: I like XFCE better than Gnome 3.
I wrote previously about trying out Gnome 3. I&rsquo;ve been using it for about a month now, and it&rsquo;s time for me to make a decision about whether to keep using it or revert to Gnome 2. I&rsquo;m actually on vacation, which ends soon. I need to do this before vacation ends, so I can be fully productive at work.
My ultimate impression of Gnome 3 is that it&rsquo;s very slick, and makes significant improvements in some ways, but it&rsquo;s not very usable for my purposes, and has too many self-contradictions.

        SQL Antipatterns, by Bill Karwin, Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2010. About 300 pages. Here&rsquo;s a link to the publisher&rsquo;s site.
I loved this book. (Disclosure: Bill is a colleague of mine.) This is the first book I&rsquo;ve read from the Pragmatic Bookshelf, and if the rest are like this one, I want to read them. The quality of the writing is way above the average technical book. Techniques that feel gimmicky and forced in other books, such as fake stories to introduce each chapter, actually work here (because they&rsquo;re real stories, not fake ones).

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jun 11, 2011</span>
        Thanks to a comment on a recent blog post where I lamented the lack of an easy-to-use password manager, I&rsquo;ve switched from Revelation to&hellip; Vim.
I already use Vim for my note-keeping system. I simply add a modeline to the top of the file,
# vim: set ic hlsearch: This makes searches case-insensitive, so I can just open the file and start typing a search, and it highlights it and moves to the first match as I type.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Jun 10, 2011</span>
        I was at a conference recently talking with a Major Cloud Hosting Provider and mentioned that for database servers, I really want large instances, quite a bit larger than the largest I can get now. The lack of cloud servers with lots of memory, many fast cores, and fast I/O and network performance leads to premature sharding, which is costly. A large number of applications can currently run on a single real server, but would require sharding to run in any of the popular cloud providers&rsquo; environments.

        MySQL Replication by Russell Dyer, Silent Killdeer, 2010. About 180 pages.
This is a pocket-sized guide to setting up and managing MySQL replication. It is self-published and made via print-on-demand technology. Topics include how replication works, setting up replication, making backups, and administering replication after it&rsquo;s working. There are several appendixes for replication-related functionality in the MySQL server and command-line tools.
This book doesn&rsquo;t go into great depth, so don&rsquo;t expect it to be a reference manual to replication internals or anything like that.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Jun 8, 2011</span>
        PostgreSQL 9 Administration Cookbook. By Simon Riggs and Hannu Krosing, Packt, 2010. Approximately 330 pages.
This is a good book for PostgreSQL database administrators to pick up, especially if you&rsquo;re new to PostgreSQL but familiar with another system such as Oracle, SQL Server, or MySQL. It has more than 80 &ldquo;recipes&rdquo; that range from quick tips to moderately detailed discussion of how to accomplish specific tasks. The chapters and recipes are well organized, and you can either read the book from start to finish or jump to a specific recipe for quick help.

        I finally upgraded from Fedora 13 to Fedora 15 on my beloved ASUS-UL30A-X5. It includes the new Gnome 3, with the &ldquo;Gnome Shell&rdquo; interface. It&rsquo;s quite different from anything else I&rsquo;ve used, and you can read lots of positive and negative impressions around the web.
Fedora 15 and Gnome 3 have awesome support for my laptop&rsquo;s hardware. It&rsquo;s simply flawless. You could not expect better software/hardware integration if you paid thousands of dollars for something from Steve Jobs.

        I bought a Barnes and Noble Nook Color e-book reader and ripped out the Nook software, replacing it with the CyanogenMod distribution of the Android OS. It&rsquo;s really, really nice hardware, and CyanogenMod (CM) is really, really nice software. I love them both, and my regular readers will remember that I&rsquo;m not a gadget guy. Read on for more.
I never thought I&rsquo;d get a tablet, until my phone died and I got a Droid 2 as a replacement.

        This post originally appeared on the Engine Yard blog.
Are your migrations the execute-and-pray variety? If so, you are probably not (yet!) running a large application. Even small applications can benefit from a more careful migration process. It&rsquo;s important to establish the process now, before things get big, because it will be much more difficult later. In my study of emergency issues, the single most valuable preventive measure I identified was change control.

        New Relic just announced the release of new features that track client-side (front-end) performance, including network time, DOM processing time, and total render time in the browser.
This is really great functionality. If you aren&rsquo;t using New Relic, you really ought to. It is a web interface to application profiling. It helps you be scientific about performance analysis without knowing it, because the functionality and the user interface make the right thing so obvious you won&rsquo;t even realize you&rsquo;re being methodical and focusing on what matters.

        I&rsquo;m going to try to explain how to make software testable in really practical terms. I won&rsquo;t use words like &ldquo;dependency injection.&rdquo; Those things annoy smart programmers and make them stop listening.
Here is a pseudocode snippet. There is some function that parses some IP address out of the output of the &ldquo;ifconfig&rdquo; command, and some other code that uses this to get an IP address and do something with it.

        Brendan Gregg has a very good ongoing series of blog posts about the importance of measuring latency at the layer that&rsquo;s appropriate for the question you are trying to answer. If you&rsquo;re wondering whether I/O latency is a problem for MySQL, you need to measure I/O latency at the filesystem layer, not the disk layer. There are a lot of factors to consider. To quote from his latest post: &gt; This isn’t really a problem with iostat(1M) – it’s a great tool for system administrators to understand the usage of their resources.

        Henrik just wrote a good article on different ways of achieving high availability with MySQL. I was going to respond in the comments, but decided it is better not to post such a long comment there.
One of the questions I think is useful to ask is what kind of high availability is desired. It is quite possible for a group of several people to stand in a hallway and talk about high availability, all of them apparently discussing the same thing but really talking about very different things.

        This month&rsquo;s Maatkit release includes a new tool that&rsquo;s kind of an old tool at the same time. We wrote it a couple years ago for a client who has a very large set of tables and many queries and developers, and wants the database&rsquo;s schema and queries to self-document for data-flow analysis purposes. At the time, it was called mk-table-access and was rather limited &ndash; just a few lines of code wrapped around some existing modules, with an output format that wasn&rsquo;t generic enough to be broadly useful.

        Vadim has taught me that valid benchmarks are both simple and complex. Simple, because the basic principles are few; complex, because the devil is in the details and it&rsquo;s a lot of work to satisfy the basic requirements. I&rsquo;ll give the simple version here.
 Benchmarks must be appropriate. The workload, sample dataset, distribution of work and data, and so on must be relevant and meaningful for the intended purpose. Running the wrong benchmark rarely teaches anything.

        I am not a fan of the MMM tool for managing MySQL replication. This is a topic of vigorous debate among different people, and even within Percona not everyone feels the same way, which is why I&rsquo;m posting it here instead of on an official Percona blog. There is room for legitimate differences of opinion, and my opinion is just my opinion. Nonetheless, I think it&rsquo;s important to share, because a lot of people think of MMM as a high availability tool, and that&rsquo;s not a decision to take lightly.

        I see that a lot of people just don&rsquo;t get it when they start talking about high availability, redundancy, failover, etc. This is probably not going to change, but maybe I can try anyway.
Let&rsquo;s think about how you can survive a massive Amazon AWS failure. You build your application to automatically move services to another part of the infrastructure that&rsquo;s still up. Great! Now assume that everyone else is smart, too.

There are a lot of risks that don&rsquo;t go away when you use cloud platforms. There are a lot of new risks that you&rsquo;ll encounter.
