  <p>In the last few years of my career, I&rsquo;ve increasingly been involved in meeting
people. This often involves requests or offers for recommendations,
introductions, and so forth.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned to be very careful about making or accepting such offers or
requests, and I&rsquo;d like to share my current thoughts about that with you, because
a lot of trouble can come of a seemingly innocent request or offer.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/02/elephant.jpg" alt="Elephant" /></p>

<h3 id="the-stakes-are-high">The Stakes Are High</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Martha, that&rsquo;s so great that you are starting a business in the diabetes care
industry! You should really meet my friend Jack. He could be extremely helpful
to you, and I am sure he would appreciate knowing about your startup.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does that sound so dangerous? Believe me, it is. A lot is on the line for you,
Martha, and Jack. Consider:</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>How well do you know Martha? What if you&rsquo;re wrong about her business? If you
introduce her to Jack, things might go wrong. They could turn out to be
competitors. Or perhaps Martha is doing something that Jack thinks is
unethical or is the wrong way to treat diabetes.</li>
<li>How well do you know Jack? Is he really going to be helpful to Martha? Does he
want to be? Does he have time to spend with her?</li>
</ul>

<p>Factors such as these mean that you are putting your relationship with Jack at
risk. You may wear out your welcome and Jack may not want to be your friend
anymore.</p>

<p>You are also risking your relationship with Martha. It sounds like this is a new
relationship, so you&rsquo;re on tenuous ground here; the risk of a misstep is high.
If it&rsquo;s more established, then you may be at lower risk, but the damage to you is
potentially higher.</p>

<p>You are, finally, putting Martha and Jack at risk in various ways. You&rsquo;re
imposing on Jack&rsquo;s time and potentially risking his reputation, and ditto for
Martha.</p>

<p>A seemingly innocent offer to help is actually writing a metaphorical check
against the Relationship Banking Account you have with Martha and Jack, and
asking them to extend credit to each other as well. Since they don&rsquo;t have a
Relationship Bank Account with each other, the credit they&rsquo;ll extend to each
other comes out of <em>your</em> accounts with them. If it&rsquo;s not a productive match,
then that withdrawal becomes a bounced check.</p>

<p>In my experiences over the last year or so, in particular, I&rsquo;ve been introduced
to a lot of people with management experience, a desire to find companies to
invest in, and so on. Most of the time, courtesy obliges me to have a phone call
or meet them for a meal or similar. Very few of these meetings have been truly
helpful to either of us. I&rsquo;m not saying anyone wasted my time, but I&rsquo;ve ended up
talking to dozens of people and the only outcomes have been pleasant
conversations.</p>

<h3 id="offering-versus-asking">Offering Versus Asking</h3>

<p>The above scenario is when you <em>offer</em> a favor. You can see how much is at risk
in that scenario.  Consider how much more is at risk when you <em>ask</em> for a favor,
such as an introduction. You are asking your friend to broker a meeting with
someone from whom you presumably <em>also</em> want to ask some favor. &ldquo;Do me a favor,
would you, and ask your friend to do you a favor so I can ask him to do me a
favor?&rdquo; It should be obvious how much credit you&rsquo;re asking everyone to extend
everyone else. You need to treat this with great care, because again if things
don&rsquo;t work out, you are not the only one who can get hurt.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s being asked for an introduction, consider the
consequences. If I said yes every time someone asked me to introduce them to a
friend of mine, soon I wouldn&rsquo;t have any friends. I need to know all of the
people well and be pretty certain that there will be a positive outcome for all
of them and myself.</p>

<p>This often means that I might need to check with my friend and see if they&rsquo;d
like to meet. Or, instead of putting them in touch with each other directly, I
might just send the asker&rsquo;s contact information on with a brief note. Or if I
don&rsquo;t have enough relationship built up with the person who&rsquo;s asking the favor,
I might need to explain that to them. This is certainly a more positive way to
build my relationship with them in the future.</p>

<p>In general, you need to have <em>earned</em> the favor with the person from whom you&rsquo;re
asking it. Otherwise you risk ending up with a negative balance in your
Relationship Bank Account.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/02/boardroom.jpg" alt="Boardroom" /></p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m going to share a few examples of when things have gone wrong, as sort of case
studies. These are all real stories, and names have been slightly abbreviated
although sometimes the parties don&rsquo;t deserve protection.</p>

<h3 id="the-pushy-investor">The Pushy Investor</h3>

<p>It is true that &ldquo;ask and you shall receive.&rdquo; If you don&rsquo;t ask, nothing happens.
But if all you do is ask, you end up <em>persona non grata</em> pretty fast.</p>

<p>In 2013 Kyle (my co-founder) and I were fundraising from venture capitalists. A
particular investor, Max G, listened to our pitch and said he&rsquo;d like to follow
up on it by calling our advisors, one of whom is at a large company. The next
thing we heard was this email from the advisor:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Phone call just ended. I think he was more interested in figuring out what
technologies my employer is interested in which wasn&rsquo;t the purpose for the call.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That never went any further as far as fundraising/investment went, but not too
long after that I got an email from Max G:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Subject: Quick Ask</p>

<p>Baron,</p>

<p>One of our fastest growing software companies is looking for a VP for
training/educational services. Who are the rock stars in the open source world
that you can recommend? Are you at liberty to tell me who the best from [&hellip;]
is? I can keep my source confidential.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Translation: he&rsquo;s asking me to help him poach from someone I respect highly.
Unfortunately, <strong>I did not think of it that way at the time.</strong> My first thought
was that <a href="/blog/2013/03/12/playing-matchmaker-for-job-seekers-and-recruiters/">I could help a friend get a dream job</a>, which is something I have
done several times in the past. So I responded. Not in a way that I feel badly
about now, but still, I wouldn&rsquo;t do it again. (How much would you bet that he
wrote an email that started out, &ldquo;Baron said that you and I should talk&hellip;&rdquo; ?)</p>

<p>Radio silence for a while.</p>

<p>Then, another email from Max G:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Subject: Company you should look at</p>

<p>[investor] and [name-drop] recently backed a high-profile entrepreneur
who most recently [&hellip;]</p>

<p>It is super early (pre-product), but we’re eager to connect with some of the
best people in demand gen to run the concept by. [&hellip;]’s name came up at
[&hellip;]. Could you run this by [&hellip;] to see if he’s open for an intro? Would
love to make the connection with him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never replied. Max G already had a negative account balance with me and I
never should have let it get that far.</p>

<p>Moral of this story is to be careful when someone asks you for a favor, lest you
end up granting it and then wishing you hadn&rsquo;t, as I did.</p>

<h3 id="the-veiled-sales-request">The Veiled Sales Request</h3>

<p>I got a connection request on LinkedIn from someone named Paul S, whose request
said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are a startup having developed a reactive programming based backend
service [database-specific details followed].
We are interested in your feedback on this and some new products we
are working on. Can we please set up a time on Webex for next week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have often enjoyed giving feedback on products and their marketing position,
both to companies developing the products, friends trying to figure out what
products they need, investors doing diligence, etc. This sounded almost like
that, but something made an alarm bell go off. I responded:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can you be more specific what kind of feedback you&rsquo;re looking for? My
expertise is fairly narrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The reply from Paul S:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our target market is database developer and architects and from your profile
it looks like you have lots of experience there. We are keen to get your
feedback on the usability of our product for these audience and the language
we ought to use to reach them. Also we are working on a new product and keen
to get your feedback on that.</p>

<p>Hope that helps and you can spare 30-45 minutes and see what we can show you and
give us some feedback.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The guy didn&rsquo;t even have the decency to comply with my request and be honest
that he was going to give me a sales pitch. I disconnected from him on LinkedIn.</p>

<h3 id="the-shotgun-blast">The Shotgun Blast</h3>

<p>Someone named Nick emailed me this through LinkedIn:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could we please talk tomorrow, We started [&hellip;] in EMEA and I would
 appreciate a call?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The thing is, the company he mentioned is someone I have a long and good
relationship with. So even though this request was out of the blue, there was no
context or reason why I&rsquo;d want to comply, I had no idea what he wanted, etc I
was reluctant to just mark it as spam. If I ignored him, I would potentially be
offering some offense or lack of grace to that company and my relationships
there, however slight, even if nobody could really blame me for declining.</p>

<p>I opted to write back:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Happy to talk, but I&rsquo;d like to know the topic first.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nick responded that he was just looking to get to know me, and later in his
message mentioned that he is looking around for a job in management and sales.
I replied that we are too early for that. But I&rsquo;d never hire someone with such
poor communications skills for a job like that anyway.</p>

<h3 id="the-request-to-promote-to-my-friends">The Request To Promote To My Friends</h3>

<p>We use a company called Intercom to embed a contact widget in our app. I haven&rsquo;t
really been all that thrilled with the product; it&rsquo;s not bad, but it&rsquo;s not
amazing. This is relevant, because while I was asking them to fix bugs for me,
they implemented a new feature instead:</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/02/intercom-asking-for-recommendation.png" alt="Intercom" /></p>

<p>Intercom definitely had not earned my recommendation. What was more irritating,
and continues to be, is that <em>the feature itself is buggy</em>. I had to email them
and ask how to disable it, because it kept showing on every page load. After
following their instructions, it continues to reappear every now and then.</p>

<p>They are being very foolish by continuing to show me this request. It&rsquo;s pushed
me more towards the point of leaving them and going to a competitor.</p>

<p>The moral of this story is that you had better earn the recommendation you ask
for.</p>

<h3 id="requests-for-my-address-book">Requests For My Address Book</h3>

<p>Once upon a time, I was looking to add my existing network to my LinkedIn
account. I thought, sure, I&rsquo;ll give them my Gmail login, why not? I&rsquo;ll just
revoke it and change my password right afterwards. No harm there, right?</p>

<p>Then I learned what they did with that: <a href="http://gigaom.com/2013/09/21/linkedin-is-breaking-into-user-emails-spamming-contacts-lawsuit/">LinkedIn is &ldquo;breaking into&rdquo; user
emails, spamming contacts – lawsuit</a>. And even after I deleted all of the
imported contacts from my account, I know they still have them, because they
continue to show me &ldquo;connection recommendations&rdquo; for people who don&rsquo;t have
LinkedIn accounts and whose names and emails are distinctively the same as the
information from my address book.</p>

<p>I will never again do something like this. I will never again install a LinkedIn
app on my phone (because it requires access to my contact list). I do not trust
LinkedIn. It is a vital tool for my professional work and career, but still,
I&rsquo;ve come close to deleting my account out of disgust and anger.</p>

<p>I similarly distrust many other services that have anything to gain from getting
access to my contact list, and that keeps me from installing a lot of their apps
on my phone.</p>

<p>Moral of the story: yuck.</p>

<h3 id="the-favor-followed-by-an-awkward-moment">The Favor Followed By An Awkward Moment</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ll end with a story where I was in the wrong.</p>

<p>While Kyle and I were fundraising I asked someone who had been very helpful to
me in the past for introductions to a couple of top-tier investors. This person
knows my work very well and has great stature in the industry. He could make a
strong representation that we were interesting to investors.  His introductions
were very helpful.</p>

<p>Later I hired one of his employees &ndash; someone who lived practically next door to
me, whose wife had a close relationship with my wife.  The last thing I wanted
to do was burn any bridges for him; what if he got a better counter-offer, or
decided at the last minute not to join? So although I normally would have said
something to his boss at some safe point, I opted to stay completely out of it.</p>

<p>I then got an email from his boss, to the effect of, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind that you
hired my employee.  But after all I&rsquo;ve done to help you, I think I deserved the
courtesy to hear about it from you first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was right, and I learned a valuable lesson from that. This was a delicate
situation, but I should have gotten advice on it. In hindsight I wish I&rsquo;d waited
for the all-clear from the new employee and given this person a call as soon as
the new employee said it was OK.</p>

<p>Moral? Well&hellip; I&rsquo;m still sad about this one. The moral is sometimes you can&rsquo;t
put Humpty Dumpty back together again.</p>
