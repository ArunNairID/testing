  <p><a href="http://www.maatkit.org/">Maatkit</a> version 2152 is ready for download. This release is also known as the &ldquo;is this project really alive?&rdquo; release. We thought we should delay until <a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2008/08/08/new-mysql-community-release-great-job-mysql/">MySQL released a new Community Server version</a>. Just kidding &ndash; it has nothing to do with that.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This release is also very significant in that it&rsquo;s the first one that has large code contributions by someone other than myself. As you may know, <a href="http://www.percona.com/">Percona</a> (my employer) has hired the <a href="http://hackmysql.com/">very talented Daniel Nichter, author of mysqlreport and other goodies</a>, to help with Maatkit. So far it is a match made in heaven, and Daniel did most of the coding for this release.</p>

<p>This is also our first release since <a href="http://develooper.com/">Ask</a> helped me move the project (thank you Ask!) to Google Code. That means you finally get a decent interface for entering issues, etc, etc. The only thing remaining on Sourceforge at this point is the online documentation, which I will probably move to maatkit.org soon. But more importantly, it means the developers have a decent interface for issues, etc etc. <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;#038;aid=1855476&amp;#038;group_id=1&amp;#038;atid=350001">Sourceforge is just a bloody nightmare &ndash; their site keeps getting harder and harder to use</a>, both as a developer and as a user. It had gotten to the point where simply adding the files to the site for download would take me hours. I tried to automate it, in true Perl fashion, but their make-a-release forms resisted my every effort. I cannot say what a relief it is to have usable project hosting that gets out of my way and lets me work. A double thanks to Ask for pushing me over the edge on this &ndash; it had been on my mind a long time. And thanks to Google, too, for a great project management interface.</p>

<p>Also note that the Sourceforge forums and mailing lists are dead. Google Groups is the preferred replacement.</p>

<p>Keep reporting those bugs and feature requests!</p>

<p>As you might expect, the changelog for such a long release cycle is, er, large. There&rsquo;s a lot of new stuff here. I&rsquo;d like to highlight the new features in mk-parallel-dump and mk-parallel-restore &ndash; which I just used to reduce a job that would have taken weeks down to mere days &ndash; and a lot of new code in mk-table-sync, as well as the up-and-coming mk-audit, which is in release-early/often mode.</p>
