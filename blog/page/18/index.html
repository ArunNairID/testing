        What is wrong with the following?
mysql&gt; select 'hello world'; +-------------+ | hello world | +-------------+ | hello world | +-------------+ 1 row in set (0.00 sec)  Centisecond resolution for query times belongs to the last century. I want at least millisecond resolution &ndash; microsecond is better. Fortunately, this is as simple as changing a printf format specifier in the mysql client program.
Edit: I thought that maybe I could fix this by changing the printf format specifier with sed, but it looks like I was wrong:

        I&rsquo;ve just committed some changes to diskstats, an I/O analysis tool in Aspersa that&rsquo;s actually been in the Subversion repository for a long time, but in a barely usable fashion and with no documentation. Now it&rsquo;s usable and documented.
It is basically a reimplementation of iostat in awk. Why on earth would I reinvent that wheel? Because I spend a lot of time gathering and analyzing raw data from /proc/diskstats, which is vital to really understanding what the storage subsystem is doing.

        A couple of extremely informative recent blog posts have gone to either Planet MySQL or Planet PostgreSQL, but not both, and I think everyone on both aggregators who cares about database internals should be interested in them. Here they are:
 Robert Haas: MySQL vs. PostgreSQL, Part 2: VACUUM vs. Purge  Ewen Fortune: How InnoDB handles REDO logging  Happy cross-pollination.

        One of my pet peeves is when documentation is wrong. Another pet peeve is keeping documentation right. Crack open a source tarball for many programs and you&rsquo;ll see a chunk of text that gets printed out when you use the &#8211;help option, and elsewhere in the program&rsquo;s source code you&rsquo;ll see the definitions of the command-line options. Maintaining a program like this is miserable. Using it is bad, too. I can name a lot of programs that say one thing and do another.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 29, 2011</span>
        InnoDB&rsquo;s checkpoint algorithm is not well documented. It is too complex to explain in even a long blog post, because to understand checkpoints, you need to understand a lot of other things that InnoDB does. I hope that explaining how InnoDB does checkpoints in high-level terms, with simplifications, will be helpful. A lot of the simplifications are because I do not want to explain the complexities of how the simple rules can be tweaked for optimization purposes, while not violating the ACID guarantees they enforce.

        I&rsquo;ll be presenting several sessions at the O&rsquo;Reilly MySQL Conference &amp; Expo 2011, which is April 11-14 in Santa Clara, California. I recommend this conference to anyone interested in open-source databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL, CouchDB, MongoDB, and others. There is very good coverage of a diverse list of open-source databases.
My sessions are as follows:
 Building on Strengths, Learning from Differences: a keynote address on the open-source database ecosystem, how we got here, and what we can do to make the most of the future.

        I&rsquo;ve released version 1.1.8 of the Better Cacti Templates project. This release includes a bunch of bug fixes and several important new graphs. There are graphs for the new response-time statistics exposed in Percona Server, and a new set of graphs for MongoDB.
 VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti.

        I read a recent blog post about the coming extinction of MySQL bloggers with concern. The post plotted the blogging activity of Planet MySQL bloggers and fit a polynomial curve to it:
Blogging Activity  The curve isn&rsquo;t extended out, but it&rsquo;s a polynomial, and we know what happens: it&rsquo;s going to intersect the X-axis. I didn&rsquo;t do the math, but if you want to, you can predict, to the day, when blogging as we know it will cease.

This is a follow-up to the enormously successful Percona Performance Conference in 2009.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 11, 2011</span>
        This isn&rsquo;t actually new &ndash; it has been out for a few releases. The mk-query-digest tool from Maatkit now outputs information about each class of queries&rsquo; variance-to-mean ratio. The new output goes in a couple of places, including perhaps most usefully the &ldquo;profile&rdquo; report. Here&rsquo;s an example from a real MySQL system:
# Profile # Rank Query ID Response time Calls R/Call Apdx V/M Item # ==== ================== ================ ===== ====== ==== ===== ======= # 1 0xBFCF8E3F293F6466 11256.

        One of the query optimization scenarios I&rsquo;ve seen a lot over the years is finding something within some distance from a point. For example, finding people within some distance of yourself, apartments in a radius from a postal code, and so on.
These queries usually use the great-circle formula. That might be because Google finds lots of pages claiming that this is the right way to do a radius search. &ldquo;The earth is not flat!

        This month&rsquo;s Maatkit release has some nice new features and improvements to mk-query-digest. There is one that deserves its own blog post: EXPLAIN sparklines.
A &ldquo;sparkline&rdquo; is a simple type of chart that conveys important information without the details. We added a kind of ASCII sparkline to mk-query-digest to convey important information about the query&rsquo;s EXPLAIN plan so you can see if the query is &ldquo;bad&rdquo; or not. It is kind of a cryptic geek code that you will need some help decoding.

        There have been a few great blog posts recently from MySQL bloggers about Postgres, and vice versa, with good comments and follow-on from the real experts in both systems. I think this is wonderful. Learning how other databases solve hard problems is highly educational, especially because ACID databases face some of the hardest problems in computing. Making MySQL better is good for PostgreSQL. The reverse is just as true. And we should also be learning from SQLite, and CouchDB, and others who have overcome tough technical hurdles, built successful companies, created thriving and enthusiastic communities, or whatever their success has been.

But aside from Andrew&rsquo;s many talents, and Sphinx&rsquo;s awesomeness, I wanted to list two related examples of how Sphinx makes the world a better place. Both examples are implemented as open-source software from Ivinco, a company founded by a group of people I used to work with.
The first is the Sphinx WordPress search plugin. I have repeatedly considered using it on my own blog, but I&rsquo;m running on Pair&rsquo;s shared hosting, so I don&rsquo;t think I should do that.
