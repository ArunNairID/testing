        <span class="post-date">Thu, Nov 17, 2005</span>
        Using a filesystem, such as an external hard drive, across mutiple platforms can sometimes cause annoying behaviors. For example, filenames may be changed to all uppercase or all lowercase, which may cause problems on a system with case-sensitive filenames or vice versa. Here are my suggestions for minimizing conflicts.
Use only letters and numbers, underscores, and dashes Avoid using characters that any system treats as special characters, not just your own.

        I have found a bug in Microsoft SQL Server&rsquo;s replace() function. The function treats char and varchar differently, and replacements will fail in some cases. Here is a demonstration of the bug:
declare @string varchar(40), @find char(2), @replace char(1) set @string = 'two spaces' set @find = ' ' set @replace = ' ' if replace(@string, @find, @replace) = 'two spaces' print 'Replacement worked' else print 'Replacement failed' Result: &ldquo;Replacement failed.

        Microsoft SQL Server&rsquo;s openxml function is highly CPU-intensive. This article demonstrates more efficient alternatives to openxml.
Why people use openxml A common usage for openxml is to use XML to pass a &ldquo;list&rdquo; or &ldquo;table&rdquo; of values into a stored procedure. Here is a scenario I&rsquo;ve seen a lot at my current job:
 An ASP accepts a string as input, such as &ldquo;ipod car adapter&rdquo; The ASP parses the input into space-separated values, then concatenates them together into XML The ASP passes the XML to a stored procedure The sproc uses openxml to populate a temporary table from the XML The sproc does some work (such as searching a product catalog)  This is fine, except openxml can cause a huge CPU spike, which is bad news in a Web-facing search server during holiday shopping season.

        Some of the neatest parts of standard HTML are the least-used. Forms in particular can become much more usable and accessible when marked up correctly with a few standard HTML elements. These are LABEL (and the related CSS outline property), OPTGROUP, LEGEND, and FIELDSET.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Nov 4, 2005</span>
        VBScript regular expressions are slightly troublesome, though they certainly help turn VBScript into less of a joke when it comes to text processing. The syntax lacks some of the niceties of Perl or .NET regexes, but is complete enough to be very useful. This article shows you how to avoid potentially serious problems, and explains an undocumented feature.
Undocumented and incorrect behavior  The documentation is incomplete. The RegExp object has an undocumented property, Multiline, which affects pattern matching using the .

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Nov 3, 2005</span>
        When gaining access to resources, such as loading a DLL or invoking a program, beware of default order of access. Insecure defaults can result in using the wrong resource. I find this particularly a problem on the Microsoft platform. Here are two cases where the Microsoft approach, designed to &ldquo;make it easy,&rdquo; ends up making it insecure instead.
Invoking an executable program If you do not specify the absolute location of the executable, where does the OS look for it?

        CAPTCHAs are tests (usually using images) designed to ensure a human is using a service, denying access to screen-scrapers and abusive script kiddies. Unfortunately they create usability and accessibility problems and can be circumvented. They are a flawed concept overall. Here are some links to sites discussing their use and problems:

        One of the greatest things about Firefox is the ability to customize the browser with extensions. By far my favorite extension is Adblock. It allows you to specify arbitrary regular expression patterns to block your browser from fetching and displaying content. The regular expression syntax is standard JavaScript syntax, based on Perl 5.
Blocking content is a delicate dance. It&rsquo;s very easy to block too much, so the patterns need to be fairly specific.

        Attribute values in XML are usually double-quoted, but single-quotes can be used as well, according to the relevant part of the XML Spec. Here is the production:
[10] AttValue ::= '"' ([^&lt;&"] | Reference)* '"' | "'" ([^&lt;&'] | Reference)* "'" In plain English: an attribute consists of
 a double or single quote any number of the following:  any character but &lt;, &amp; or &ldquo; OR an entity reference  the same character that was used to begin the attribute (double or single quote)  What&rsquo;s most interesting about this to me is that a &lt; is forbidden inside attribute values, but a &gt; is not.
