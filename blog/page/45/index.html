        <span class="post-date">Mon, Feb 19, 2007</span>
        This article explains how to do subtraction in SQL over samples that wrap back to zero when they exceed a boundary.
A reader wrote in with a question about how to find how much traffic has passed through a network interface. The reader has a script that samples the interface&rsquo;s statistics and stores them in a database. The statistics wrap back around when they exceed the maximum size of an integer, so it&rsquo;s not a strictly increasing sequence.

        Last week I read two books on Nagios. I found one easy to use and the other difficult.
 Note: VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production. VividCortex offers MySQL performance monitoring and PostgreSQL performance management among many other features.
 The books 
Nagios System and Network Monitoring (Wolfgang Barth, No Starch Press, 2006) is a delight.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Feb 10, 2007</span>
        Pro MySQL, by Mike Kruckenberg and Jay Pipes, covers advanced MySQL topics, especially focusing on optimization and internals. I give it a solid 4 stars.
Overview  Pro MySQL covers a lot of topics you need to know, and probably will not learn about anywhere else.
The book&rsquo;s target audience is MySQL professionals. The authors assume significant depth of background in the subject area, and strive to put the finishing touches on your education &ndash; to take you from apprentice to journeyman, so to speak.

        By reader request, this article explains ways to remove duplicate rows when they are completely identical, and you don&rsquo;t have a primary key or other criterion to identify which rows to &ldquo;save.&rdquo;
This is a special case of deleting duplicates. I&rsquo;ve written another article about the more general case, so I assume you have the background it gives. If not, you should probably go read my article about how to delete duplicate rows in SQL.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Feb 3, 2007</span>
        innotop 1.3.5 is the latest release of the increasingly popular MySQL and InnoDB monitor. I recommend everyone upgrade to this release. Aside from incomplete documentation, it&rsquo;s close to a stable 1.4 release (I&rsquo;m counting on you to find the bugs!). There are many significant new features since version 1.3, which make it more powerful and easier to use. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s new:
 Support for colorizing rows. Default color rules are included for Q, T and M modes; it&rsquo;s easy to write your own.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Jan 31, 2007</span>
        In part 1 of this series I examined the behavior of MySQL&rsquo;s FEDERATED storage engine by running queries with the general query log enabled on the remote server. In this article I take a higher-level view. I summarize my findings from the first article, then give my thoughts on the engine&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses.
How the engine works The FEDERATED engine accesses a remote table via a normal mysql client connection.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Jan 29, 2007</span>
        MySQL&rsquo;s FEDERATED storage engine is a fascinating example of the flexibility gained by abstracting the storage engine layer away from the rest of the server. FEDERATED tables allow you to access a table on another server as though it exists on the local server. However, the manual doesn&rsquo;t say much about how it really works, MySQL&rsquo;s only developer article about it is vague and unrealistic, and there are more questions than answers on the net about the engine&rsquo;s features and behavior.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Jan 25, 2007</span>
        MySQL has no built-in functionality to calculate a table&rsquo;s checksum in any storage engine but MyISAM (this is not true; I read the manual wrong, but it doesn&rsquo;t eliminate the usefulness of the technique in this article). Table checksums can confirm that two tables are identical &ndash; useful to verify a replica server is in sync with its master (see my article on reliable MySQL replication for more). Fortunately, it&rsquo;s easy to calculate a checksum on non-MyISAM tables with user variables.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 20, 2007</span>
        MySQL statement-based replication is widely discussed, but I haven&rsquo;t seen much about how to design a replication setup for low downtime and easy administration. Statement-based replication has inherent shortcomings experienced MySQL users know to avoid, but rarely write about. This article explains how to avoid problems, help your replicas stay in sync with the master, and recover from disasters more quickly.
By the way, I&rsquo;m fairly new to MySQL replication.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 20, 2007</span>
        Late in 2006 MySQL decided to move to a split distribution model, Community and Enterprise. A lot has (apparently) changed since then, yet nothing has really changed since then. These things remain true:
 MySQL is freely available in both source and binary form &ndash; free as in freedom, and free as in beer. The MySQL community continues to get every single bug fix for free. The only real change the MySQL community sees is less frequent official binary builds.

Version number policy Odd-numbered releases, such as 1.3.0, contain the code that will eventually become a stable release &ndash; in this case 1.4. Not all the features are there, and not all of them work perfectly, but it&rsquo;s a development snapshot for community review and feedback.

        This article explains how to create a fixed-size FIFO (first-in, first-out) queue in SQL, where rows added after a threshold will cause the oldest row to be deleted. There are several ways to do this, but MERGE on Oracle and DB2, and MySQL&rsquo;s non-standard extensions to SQL, make an elegant solution easy.
Update a PostgreSQL blogger pointed out the obvious method I missed: triggers! There&rsquo;s also a really neat PG-specific feature that allows it to work even more elegantly on that platform.

        I recently read O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s SQL Hacks, by Andrew Cumming and Gordon Russell. It&rsquo;s an interesting and rewarding mixture of tips and tricks for novice to expert users.
Overview The book consists of 100 hacks, organized into 12 chapters whose topics and level roughly progress from complete novice to advanced. There are 366 pages of real content. The index is good; for example, on the topic of dates, which is one of the main things I use references for, it has dozens of entries, many pointing to the same entries but worded in a different way, which can be very helpful for such a topic.

Brian&rsquo;s skeleton project is different from mine. Mine is just a skeleton for a Perl script, not an entire software project. But perhaps you&rsquo;ll find it useful anyway.
The code included in the file takes care of getting all the info you need to connect to a MySQL instance.

        I sometimes see advice to do SQL date operations with the + and &#8211; operators on platforms where they are overloaded for date types. I try to avoid that, because it can give unexpected results. I prefer to explicitly use the built-in date/time functions. I&rsquo;ll show you an example where the operators cause problems, but the functions do the right thing.
My example is in MySQL, but it applies to some other systems too.

        MySQL&rsquo;s user variables have interesting properties that enable the useful techniques I wrote about in recent articles. One property is that you can read from and assign to a user variable simultaneously, because an assignment can be an r-value (the result of the assignment is the final value of the variable). Another property, which sometimes causes confusing behavior, is un-intuitive evaluation time. In this post I&rsquo;ll show you how to make sure your variables get updated at the time they&rsquo;re used, instead of potentially reading and updating them at different stages of query execution.

        It&rsquo;s been a while since I released an update to the innotop InnoDB and MySQL monitor, but I have not been idle. I&rsquo;m currently working hard to add major new features and functionality. Here&rsquo;s a quick list of what&rsquo;s coming, much of which is done already but still slightly broken:
 Arbitrary user-defined expressions can be the source of a column in a tabular view. You are not limited to choosing from the columns I&rsquo;ve defined; you can add your own, and base it directly on the available data or write an expression to calculate what you want.

There are still many things I like about Gentoo.
For one thing, the developer and user community are great (I have written about this several times before).
