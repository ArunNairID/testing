        Joel Spolsky writes about 12 steps to better code, and elsewhere about how candidates should write code in interviews.
The reverse conditions are true, too. If you&rsquo;re a candidate, you should evaluate the employer against the 12 steps, and you should also see code samples. How else will you know what you&rsquo;re getting into? You really have the right to do this, and you should exercise the right. If you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;ll get stuck in a crap job maintaining crap code.

        I&rsquo;m going to be at beCamp 2008, the followup to the first beCamp, which I sadly missed.
beCamp is a BarCamp un-conference. Tonight was about meeting, greeting, and throwing ideas at the wall to see which ones stick. Literally. We stuck pieces of paper on the wall with our ideas &ndash; things we can either talk about or want to hear about &ndash; and then scratched our votes on them to see which are popular.

        Zack Urlocker says MySQL 5.1 has zero bugs. He may have been misquoted, or quoted out of context, but there it is. I&rsquo;ll quote enough of it that you can&rsquo;t take it out of context twice:
 Mickos also said MySQL 5.1 has upgraded its reliability and ease of use over 2005&#8242;s v5.0.  "Now we can admit it, but this version is much improved over 5.0, which we weren't totally happy with,"

        If you&rsquo;re waiting for High Performance MySQL Second Edition to hit the shelf, you&rsquo;re not the only one. I am too! I can&rsquo;t wait to actually hold it in my hands.
But you don&rsquo;t have to wait idly. No, not at all! You can pre-order it and then you&rsquo;ll get it as soon as possible. Plus your pre-order will help them figure out how much demand there is, so it doesn&rsquo;t sell out and make you wait for your own copy.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Apr 27, 2008</span>
        As promised, I&rsquo;ve created some improved software for monitoring MySQL via Cacti. I began using the de facto MySQL Cacti templates a while ago, but found some things I needed to improve about them. As time passed, I rewrote everything from scratch. The resulting templates are much improved.
 VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti.

Topics: everything and anything, including Maatkit and PostgreSQL.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Apr 23, 2008</span>
        The conference that many of us just went to is called the MySQL Conference and Expo, but a lot of people don&rsquo;t call it that. They call it by the name it had in 2006 and earlier: MySQL User&rsquo;s Conference. In fact, some people say (or blog) that they dislike the new name and they&rsquo;re going to call it the old name, because [&hellip; insert reason here&hellip;].
I call it by the new name that some people dislike so much.

        Here&rsquo;s a rundown of Thursday (day 3) of the MySQL Conference and Expo. This day&rsquo;s sessions were much more interesting to me than Wednesday&rsquo;s, and in fact I wanted to go to several of them in a single time slot a couple of times.
Inside the PBXT Storage Engine This session was, as it sounds, a look at the internals of PBXT, a transactional storage engine for MySQL that has some interesting design techniques.

        Keith Murphy and his hard-working crew have released the spring 2008 issue of MySQL Magazine. Go take a look &ndash; it includes quite a few articles on various topics, even a mention of our upcoming book (High Performance MySQL, Second Edition).

        Day two of the conference was a little disappointing, as far as sessions went. There were several time blocks where I simply wasn&rsquo;t interested in any of the sessions. Instead, I went to the expo hall and tried to pry straight answers out of sly salespeople. Here&rsquo;s what I attended.
Paying It Forward: Harnessing the MySQL Contributory Resources This was a talk focused on how MySQL has made it possible for community members to contribute to MySQL.

        If you&rsquo;re at the MySQL Conference and Expo, you can get a free sample chapter of the upcoming High Performance MySQL Second Edition. Just go to the exhibition area. As you go through the doors, take an immediate left and look for the sample chapter on O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s table. It&rsquo;s a rough draft and contains typos and my incredibly crude drawings instead of those that will go into the final book, but it should serve to give you an idea of the book&rsquo;s depth and scope.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Apr 16, 2008</span>
        Today is the first day at the conference (aside from the tutorials, which were yesterday). Here&rsquo;s what I went to:
New Subquery Optimizations in 6.0 By Sergey Petrunia. This was a similar session to one I went to last year. MySQL has a few cases where subqueries are badly optimized, and this session went into the details of how this is being addressed in MySQL 6.0. There are several new optimization techniques for all types of subqueries, such as inside-out subqueries, materialization, and converting to joins.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Apr 15, 2008</span>
        There are quite a few business angles you might see only if you&rsquo;re here at the conference, and you won&rsquo;t get from blogs. For example, let&rsquo;s take a look at the contents of the shoulder bags they hand out with your registration. (This is only a partial list.)
 SnapLogic&rsquo;s flyer gets it right: their system is compatible with &ldquo;GNU Linux.&rdquo; Hooray, a commercial company acknowledging the GNU operating system for what it is!

        MySQL just gave me an award at this morning&rsquo;s keynote, along with Sheeri Kritzer Cabral (for the second year in a row!) and Diego Medina, for my code contributions to the MySQL community, specifically Maatkit, which makes it easier to make MySQL reliable, fast, and robust. It&rsquo;s an honor to be recognized. And while I could leave it at that, I&rsquo;d like to say a word or two more.
The economy, community, and ecosystem that&rsquo;s building around Free Software can often be very rewarding financially.

        I spent the day Thursday with some of Kickfire&rsquo;s engineers at their headquarters. In this article, I&rsquo;d like to go over a little of the system&rsquo;s architecture and some other details.
Everything in quotation marks in this article is a quote. (I don&rsquo;t use quotes when I&rsquo;m glossing over a technical point &ndash; at least, not in this article.)
Even though I saw one of Kickfire&rsquo;s engineers running queries on the system, they didn&rsquo;t let me actually take the keyboard and type into it myself.

        I&rsquo;m at the MySQL Conference and the t-shirts I created for Maatkit have arrived. Come get yours! They are high-quality, attractive shirts you&rsquo;ll be proud to wear, and they are a nice rich wine-red color.
Harrison Fisk (co-author of MySQL Clustering) got the first one, because he told me that he recommends Maatkit to MySQL Support customers about twice a week. I made sure to save one for Jay Pipes too, because his luggage got lost so he has nothing to wear.

        This year&rsquo;s conference has a great lineup. As usual, with 8 sessions concurrently, it&rsquo;s impossible to pick which ones I want to see. However, I did learn a few things from last year&rsquo;s conference, which I think will help me get more out of it this time.
Number one rule: not all sessions are created equal. I can&rsquo;t say for sure, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure that when you see &ldquo;How Product X Will Scale Your Databases&rdquo; presented by a person from Company X, you can reasonably suspect that Company X is paying for this privilege, and it&rsquo;s not really a session as much as a product demo.

        Just a quick note: Kickfire is not based on SSD (solid-state device) hard drives. Their old website says &ldquo;SQL goes solid state&rdquo; but that just means SQL in hardware, not SSD.
When I was a child, we had a Sears Lady Kenmore clothes washing machine that boasted &ldquo;solid-state circuits&rdquo; on the panel, in flowery script writing. It was not based on SSD, either.
Finally, I am not on the Kickfire payroll.

This article explains the basics of how their technology is different from the current state of the art in complex queries on large amounts of data.
Kickfire is developing a MySQL appliance that combines a pluggable storage engine (for MySQL 5.

I had a good time and really enjoyed meeting everyone, listening, learning, and occasionally talking. I asked a number of fearless-newbie questions that paid off handsomely: people were very willing to humor me. I also left with a beautiful t-shirt, mug, and bag combo thanks to EnterpriseDB. The bag has already been put to use for a grocery shopping trip.
