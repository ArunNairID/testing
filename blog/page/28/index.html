        It seems that a lot of people want to try to improve MySQL performance by focusing on server status counters and configuration variables. Looking at counters, and &ldquo;tuning the server,&rdquo; is better than nothing, but only barely. You care first and foremost about how long it takes to execute a query, not about how many of this-and-that the server performs or about how big or small this-and-that buffer is. What you really need is timing information.

        I&rsquo;ve had several customers in the last week or so who need a way to verify that their application will work well after an upgrade. I&rsquo;m seeking input on a new tool to help with MySQL upgrades. Please add comments, either here or on the bug report, or on the mailing list topic.
If someone wants to sponsor this work, that would also be welcomed.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, May 26, 2009</span>
        One of the minor things I&rsquo;ve noticed when I use Thunderbird on my IMAP accounts is that it doesn&rsquo;t download IMAP messages until I click on them. Then I have to wait until I can see the message. I have heard that this is supposed to be fixed in Thunderbird 3, and I tried it but a lot of the extensions I need aren&rsquo;t compatible with it.
Today I finally tried to search and find out more about the problem.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, May 9, 2009</span>
        A while ago I posted about a comment a Sun performance engineer made about a scalable replacement for InnoDB. At the time, I did not believe it referred to Falcon. In hindsight, it seems even clearer that the Sun performance experts were already working hard on InnoDB itself.
Sun&rsquo;s engineers have shown that they can produce great results when they really take the problems seriously. And I&rsquo;m sure that InnoDB&rsquo;s performance has untapped potential we don&rsquo;t see right now.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, May 8, 2009</span>
        In the past I have taken a somewhat neutral stance on the non-Free nature of the MySQL documentation, but after the recent discussion about it I&rsquo;ve reconsidered. I have changed my position; now I see the restrictions on the documentation as a serious problem for the community and partner ecosystem.
The arguments I&rsquo;ve heard in favor of keeping the documentation non-Free do not hold up well when you shine a bright light on them, in my opinion.

        I&rsquo;ve packaged up and released version 1.1.2 of the Cacti templates I&rsquo;ve written for MySQL, Apache, memcached, nginx etc.
 VividCortex is the startup I founded in 2012. It&rsquo;s the easiest way to monitor what your servers are doing in production and I consider it far superior to Cacti. VividCortex offers MySQL performance monitoring and PostgreSQL performance management among many other features.
 Anyone who would like to help write documentation (or do anything else, for that matter) is welcomed to participate.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, May 5, 2009</span>
        As I was driving with a colleague in California a couple of weeks ago during the conference, the topic of conversation turned to the notion that Percona and the rest of the MySQL community really need the presence of a central entity that provides a recognized home for the MySQL server. The conversation went something like &ldquo;I was talking to so-and-so, and he said, you know, you guys really need Sun/MySQL, because without the mother ship, things will fall apart and your own business will fail.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, May 4, 2009</span>
        Maatkit version 3519 is ready for download. There are a lot of changes in this release, many of which are incompatible with previous releases. There are also a lot of important new features. Read on for the details.
First, thanks to everyone who contributed to this month&rsquo;s release. A lot of people have jumped into Maatkit and started committing code. I attribute this to deliberately forcing a more open policy with decisions being made on the mailing list, rather than the former policy of &ldquo;Percona pays for development, so they have more say than you do&rdquo; &ndash; a snobby and ill-advised way to treat an open-source project.

        If you code by writing tests that fail, and then fixing the tests by writing the code, then you might find yourself switching to a terminal, running the test, ad nauseum. Part 1 of my tip is to run the test in a loop that takes a single keystroke to trigger:
$ while read line; do clear; perl MyTestScript.t; done This works with any language, not just perl &ndash; just replace the test command with the right one.

        Domas Mituzas mentioned this recently. It&rsquo;s so cool I just have to write about it. Here&rsquo;s an easy command to fork off a bunch of jobs in parallel: xargs.
seq 10 20 | xargs -n 1 -P 5 sleep This will send a sequence of numbers to xargs, which will divide it into chunks of one argument at a time and fork off 5 parallel processes to execute each. You can see it in action:

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Apr 29, 2009</span>
        At the MySQL conference, a person who used to hold an important position in an important sales organization told us something like the following: &ldquo;You know, you guys at Percona are great, but you have a big problem. You don&rsquo;t have any $500,000 customers who only file one support incident per year. Those customers are where you can really make big money.&rdquo;
We were well aware of the investigations this person did into which customers are the most profitable, and we had decided a long time ago that chasing huge sales without delivering matching services is flawed.

        Peter wrote about this recently, but I don&rsquo;t know if it was really clear what was going on.
Point One: Sphinx can be contacted by the MySQL protocol. Not &ldquo;as a MySQL storage engine.&rdquo; Not &ldquo;from MySQL.&rdquo; It understands the MySQL protocol itself. So from the protocol point of view, the Sphinx search daemon can look just like a MySQL server.
Point Two: Sphinx understands a SQL-like query language. Don&rsquo;t be fooled.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Apr 25, 2009</span>
        Cacti is a great tool for collecting information about systems and graphing it. However, it likes to use SNMP, and SNMP is often not desirable. Instead, I often see the need for a method that is:
 Secure. Use trusted, well-known, encrypted communication. Do not open up new ports. Zero install on the monitored system. As little installation or modification on the monitoring system as possible.  Over the last several years, I&rsquo;ve slowly created more and more software to create Cacti graphs via standard POSIX command-line utilities over SSH with key-pair authentication.

        MySQL 5.4 was released this week at the MySQL conference, and billed as the &ldquo;community release.&rdquo; This seemed odd to some of us, and I heard lots of comment on it in the hallways. After all, the release was a surprise; the community didn&rsquo;t know it was happening.
A source from within Sun, who is familiar with the details and wishes to remain anonymous, told me the story behind the release.

        As you may have noticed, Calpont has been advertising themselves as an open-source storage engine for MySQL. And yet there is no source code.
A bit of back-story. When we were choosing speakers for the Percona Performance Conference, I personally reviewed Calpont&rsquo;s submission and sent them an email on March 19th:
 I cannot confirm that this is an open-source columnar storage engine. I can&rsquo;t find source code or a download of the software.

        This morning&rsquo;s MySQL Conference keynotes had a number of inaccuracies, but one that I wish to point out is the characterizations of Drizzle. It looks to me like some Sun/Oracle/MySQL folks are trying to take credit, now that they&rsquo;re seeing it become a resounding success, for the good work of the Drizzle project. It is not a technology incubator, nor is it the &ldquo;MySQL Drizzle Project.&rdquo; It is a new database server.

        How Life Imitates Chess, by Garry Kasparov, 2008. 204 pages.
I've been wanting to write a review of this book for a while. I forget now exactly when I got it, but I have greatly enjoyed reading it. I have read it several times. It's a book on decision making (it's not really a book about chess) from a man who's Russian (which matters because I work with many Russians), a master of decision making, and not least of all -- he has taken on the world's toughest opponents and continues to do so today.
