        <span class="post-date">Wed, Apr 26, 2006</span>
        Coding standards are a Good Thing. Unfortunately, most organizations don&rsquo;t have much in the way of SQL coding standards, and there aren&rsquo;t many automated tools to help. As a result, I believe SQL is often less consistently written than many other languages. Here are my suggestions.
The following are only my opinions.
Indentation I use indentation as with any other programming language. I prefer to indent the beginning of each clause in a statement equally, because I consider them all equally important; in other words, I don&rsquo;t consider the ORDER BY clause somehow &ldquo;inferior to&rdquo; the WHERE clause.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 24, 2006</span>
        X11 comes with unattractive mouse cursors, but it&rsquo;s trivial to replace them with other themes. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain how to install mouse cursors system-wide or for a single user, and give you links to my favorite cursor themes.
Nicely crafted mouse cursors are very important for usability, in my opinion. I need my mouse cursors to be unobtrusive, yet really easy to see. They need to be easy to find without peering at the screen or waving the mouse wildly, and easy to use precisely on every kind of background.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Apr 23, 2006</span>
        It is possible to explicitly insert values into an AUTO_INCREMENT in MySQL, but sometimes these inserts cause confusing behavior. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain that behavior.
Background Suppose I have the following table:
create table number ( number int not null auto_increment primary key ) ; Now suppose I insert some values into the primary key explicitly, bypassing the AUTO_INCREMENT feature:
insert into number(number) values (-100); select * from number; +--------+ | number | +--------+ | -100 | +--------+ So far, so good.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Apr 20, 2006</span>
        This article demonstrates how to &ldquo;roll your own&rdquo; surrogate keys and sequences in a platform-independent way, using standard SQL.
Surrogate keys Relational theory talks about something called a &ldquo;candidate key.&rdquo; In SQL terms, a candidate key is any combination of columns that uniquely identifies a row (SQL and the relational model aren&rsquo;t the same thing, but I&rsquo;ll put that aside for this article). The data&rsquo;s primary key is the minimal candidate key.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 17, 2006</span>
        Suppose I try to create a table with a primary key that&rsquo;s varchar(500), and MySQL complains the key length is longer than the maximum of 1000 bytes. 500 is less than 1000. What&rsquo;s happening? In this article I&rsquo;ll explain why I, not MySQL, am wrong. Plus, I&rsquo;ll show you a tasty (yet apparently harmless) bug in MySQL.
Here&rsquo;s a statement that will fail on my server:
create table test(c varchar(250), d varchar(250), primary key(c,d)); ERROR 1071 (42000): Specified key was too long; max key length is 1000 bytes Why does it fail?

        Odd characters can sometimes cause problems with character data in MySQL. These characters are easy to accidentally import from a CSV file or other data source, but hard to detect because they don&rsquo;t always display correctly.

        In this article I&rsquo;ll explain how to control the output of the mysql client program and feed it to another program to transform the results as desired. I often transform output into HTML tables for these blog articles &ndash; at least, I do when I&rsquo;m not being lazy.
The mysql command-line program can accept a command and print the results directly to STDOUT. The default output behavior differs depending on where its input comes from.

Cascading updates and deletes can be turned on between tables related with foreign keys in many RDBMSs.

In this article I&rsquo;ll discuss some of the ways cascades can do invisible things, and show you one place they can be very handy too.

        Temporary tables behave very differently across various database servers. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with MySQL, some things might catch you off guard. In this article I explain some subtleties of temporary tables in MySQL and explain when you might encounter problems with them. I also show you how the platform-specific features can sometimes be very useful indeed.
Creating temporary tables In MySQL, creating a temporary table has exactly the same syntax as creating a regular table, with a few restrictions (no foreign keys, for example).

        I recently watched a video of Hans Reiser&rsquo;s presentation on ReiserFS, a journalling filesystem. It piqued my curiosity, so I visited the ReiserFS website to read more about the filesystem. I ended up un-learning some things I thought I knew, and had some thoughts to share on ReiserFS in general.
 The Reiser team believes equal access to source code is a civil right. I agree. I&rsquo;ve been using version 3 for a long time.
