        <span class="post-date">Thu, Apr 21, 2011</span>
        These days it seems that people would rather generate a shortlink than use a real link, even when it&rsquo;s not much shorter. It&rsquo;s hip, after all. (Peter actually caught me doing this. It was for a link that used to be long but was shortened recently so a shortlink isn&rsquo;t needed anymore. I did it to continue a habit, not for hipness.)
I&rsquo;ve begun to see an increasing number of drawbacks to short link services.

        I am ridiculously far behind on reading blog posts since the MySQL conference. I like to lag somewhat behind, because then when I read the posts I get to see some comments. But I&rsquo;m much farther behind now than I want to be. This is mostly the fault of the MySQL replication, Performance Schema, NDB Cluster, and InnoDB developers, who just announced a large number of improvements in the upcoming MySQL 5.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 18, 2011</span>
        I split my time last week between the IOUG&rsquo;s Collaborate conference in Orlando, Florida and O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s MySQL Conference &#038; Expo in California. The contrast was stark. For me as a MySQLer, Collaborate was a dud. On the other hand, the MySQL conference O&rsquo;Reilly puts on is superb. It is vital to MySQL as a project and as a community, and it follows that it&rsquo;s vital to MySQL&rsquo;s business success. Oracle needs to participate to make it a success in the future.

        Those of you who&rsquo;ve been following my recent work on modeling system scalability might be interested in this. (It&rsquo;s not my work, by the way. I&rsquo;m just trying to ski in the wake of Neil Gunther.)
I&rsquo;ve measured quite a few systems that have some strange bubbles in the scalability curve. As I explained in my talk on Thursday, systems don&rsquo;t always follow the model precisely, because of their internal architecture.

        If you&rsquo;ve used OpenOffice.org Impress to run a slideshow with your laptop plugged into an external monitor or projector, you&rsquo;ve probably noticed that it prefers to switch the primary and secondary display, showing you the slideshow while it shows your audience the notes and preview of your next slide! This is exactly the reverse of what you want, which is to show your audience the slideshow and let you see notes, the countdown timer, and so on.

        People keep asking me &ldquo;what is going to happen to MySQL now that Oracle has screwed MySQL?&rdquo; I bluntly disagree that any such thing has happened. This blog post is just my personal view and does not reflect my employer&rsquo;s opinion, but Oracle might have saved MySQL from what I can see. There is no evidence that supports the hysterical doomsday theories. (Witness MySQL 5.5, probably the best MySQL release in history.

        Working at Percona has taught me to love being disruptive and creating innovative pricing models. In particular, their pay-as-you-go pricing in 15-minute increments, plus the ability to go from first contact to having them logged in and working in a few minutes with just a credit card, has been game-changing. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to take that to the next level and create a new business, offering MySQL services with a radically simple pricing model.

        I see that &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; has become the new buzzword with a spike of hype around it. Everyone&rsquo;s jumping on it. Companies are eager to promote their products as &ldquo;Big Data,&rdquo; just as they were eager to be associated with Web 2.0, Service-Oriented Architectures, and all the rest. Predictably, there&rsquo;s basically zero agreement on what it means.
I&rsquo;ve seen &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo; mentioned in the context of 1TB, which I think is rather moderate sized.

The command simply throws a syntax error:
alter table t exchange partition p1 with table t2; The worklog is still open, although a related bug report it mentions is closed and pushed into trunk.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Mar 18, 2011</span>
        I gather a lot of statistics such as performance data. Sometimes I have multiple things going on a system and I want to be able to align and compare the resulting data from multiple processes later. That means they need to be aligned on time intervals. Here is a naive way to gather stats at intervals:
while sleep 1; do gather-some-stats; done  There are two problems: each iteration will take longer than a second, so there will be drift; and the iterations will not be aligned exactly on the clock ticks, so the data isn&rsquo;t as easy to correlate with other samples.

For those who know MySQL, this won&rsquo;t be exciting, but if you&rsquo;re new to it, I hope it will be a good orientation to what you should focus on and ignore.
Sheeri Cabral posted a good round-up of the MySQL talks at Collaborate on the PalominoDB blog.

        I often need to watch a server that&rsquo;s very minimally configured, e.g. has no Perl DBI libraries installed, and I shouldn&rsquo;t install anything. The following snippet is a quick way to do that:
watch 'mysqladmin proc | grep -v Sleep | cut -b0-130' Replace 130 by the width of your terminal, naturally.
(Of course, innotop is much more featureful than mytop, but mytop is the essential functionality we&rsquo;re going for here!

Rails makes database interaction so simple that it&rsquo;s easy to forget that the database isn&rsquo;t always happy with what Rails does to it. Here are three leading mistakes that hurt many Rails applications:
1. Using IN() subqueries MySQL supports a few different types of subqueries. Unfortunately, one of them is a performance disaster. Even more unfortunately, that particular type is the most natural and intuitive way to write a few common query patterns.

        I&rsquo;ve seen this a handful of times: someone has trouble with their database performance, and they have heard that XtraDB is much faster than InnoDB. They build a custom-compiled server with XtraDB.
This is unfortunately missing the point a bit. If you have a server that is the same as normal MySQL, but you&rsquo;ve replaced InnoDB by XtraDB, what do you have? Depending on the version of MySQL you&rsquo;re using, you have somewhere between, say, 1.
