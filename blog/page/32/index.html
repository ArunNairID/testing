        If you were to gird up your loins and learn PostgreSQL performance optimization from scratch, but already knowing where to find the articles and manuals and stuff online, what URLs would you be visiting? What core bits of PostgreSQL would you focus on understanding the most deeply? What books would you buy?
Note: if your comment doesn&rsquo;t appear it probably went into the spam queue because of links. I&rsquo;ll retrieve it, don&rsquo;t worry.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Dec 11, 2008</span>
        With all the furor over MySQL 5.1 GA, its release schedule, its quality, etc etc I think a fundamental claim is being left un-examined. Lots of people are saying that if you leave out the new features in 5.1 and look only at the features that existed in 5.0, it&rsquo;s better quality.
The implication is that the process of building 5.1 looked like this: rip out nasty code and fix it all up, so there&rsquo;s a brand new architecture free of code debt.

 Korean Russian Portuguese Polish Spanish Czech  Some of them were sold quite a while ago, and some are more recent. Portuguese was the first.

        The December release is here! There are some goodies in this release, but the major one is an initial version of mk-log-parser, a slow log analysis tool that is carefully designed (with lots of input from Percona consultants) to make slow log analysis as productive and easy as possible. It&rsquo;s based on a lot of work Daniel and I have done on log analysis over the years (I actually wrote the initial version a long time ago but never released it).

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Nov 26, 2008</span>
        If you were to measure MySQL&rsquo;s &ldquo;loadavg,&rdquo; how would you do it?
The following metric (in pseudocode) is borrowed from Trevor Price at Aggregate Knowledge. It&rsquo;s a way to calculate average query response time. What do you think of it?
$start = microtime(); $status1 = SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE Questions; for ( 1 .. 100 ) { $num_running += SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SHOW PROCESSLIST WHERE Command = Query; } $time = microtime() - $start; return 0 unless $time; $status2 = SHOW GLOBAL STATUS LIKE Questions; $qps = ($status2 - $status1) / $time; return 0 unless $qps; return ($num_running / 100) / $qps;  If you do the dimensional analysis, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, it works.

        Google Code just rocks. It is clean, sparse, elegant, and it has all the functionality I need. Its template-driven issue tracking system (totally flexible and totally easy to flex!), niceties like cross-references between issues and Subversion revisions, simple but completely adequate Wiki, and nice download system are the bomb. And the code reviews and ability to comment on revisions are super nice. Oh, and it&rsquo;s really nice that the data is stored in a place I feel pretty sure is safe.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 22, 2008</span>
        This is a quick informal poll. I&rsquo;d like to know how much network traffic your server receives (not sends), in bytes per second. Give both avg and max if you have them. I&rsquo;m especially interested in hearing about big, heavily loaded systems.
I&rsquo;ll start things off: just by looking at a couple of customer systems, I see one customer&rsquo;s server is at 56k and 79k per second. Another slightly larger one is pulling 76k average and 200k max.

        MySQL just released their new MySQL Query Analyzer (link to a trial), and recently wrote up an interview with Mark Matthews about it. If you haven&rsquo;t read that article, go ahead and do it. I have not used this software, but I fully believe its functionality is quite nice.
But there is at least one alternative, which has been available for a long time. That is the Percona patch-set, plus analysis tools such as mysqlsla or Maatkit&rsquo;s query analysis tools.

I have to spend the next couple of days catching up on other things that have gotten delayed, but will try to write more about the experience later.

        I have calmed down after my frustration of a few days ago.Â My conscience says I was being unfair to Sun&rsquo;s employees, who are just trying to make a business succeed in difficult times, and who support OpenSQL Camp, Maatkit, MySQL, and many other things that are dear to me.Â To those I treated harshly, I&rsquo;m sorry. Just like email, blog posts are easy to publish and impossible to take back.

        I wanted to make readers who are web designers aware of a new resource for learning about raw performance (page load time and render time). This is the Web Scaling Blog, a blog my employer started a while ago and didn&rsquo;t really update, but which is now starting to get some in-depth content thanks to a very smart colleague of mine, Nail Kashapov. There are a lot of practical, real-world examples of how you can dig deep into front-end performance and make your site really load fast.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Nov 6, 2008</span>
        PHP has no built-in debugger.
This is HUGE. The ability to say perl -d .... and have a fully featured, gdb-like debugger at your command, with absolutely nothing to download or install, is HUGE.
Debugging PHP is an epic pain in the best of circumstances, and it&rsquo;s all but impossible on a system you don&rsquo;t control and can&rsquo;t waste a bunch of time on even if you had permission to install things.

I found what I think is a pretty good way to set up host interface networking.</p>

        The soft registration deadline for OpenSQL Camp 2008 has passed now; you can still attend, but you won&rsquo;t be counted into meals and t-shirts.

A big thanks to Sheeri and others who kept the wheels turning while I was traveling recently.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 1, 2008</span>
        <p>I&rsquo;m really really happy about <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu 8.10</a> because it lets me stop kicking myself so much for buying a Dell Inspiron 1501. This little laptop was the el-cheapo option for me, found via <a href="http://www.dealnews.com/">dealnews.com</a>. I was going to buy the virtually identical one that came with Ubuntu installed, but then Dell offered a deal on the 1501, which had Windows Vista, and I caved in to the allure of saving about $200.</p>

<p>Of course I promptly discovered that the two most important differences between the models involved hardware for which no good Free Software drivers existed: the video card and the wireless card. The Inspiron 1501 has a &ldquo;ATI Technologies Inc RS482 [Radeon Xpress 200M]&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Broadcom Corporation BCM4311 802.11b/g WLAN (rev 01)&rdquo;.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Oct 26, 2008</span>
        <p>At my previous employer, one of the early decisions that had huge payoffs later was the SQL naming conventions. A good naming convention is more than just a nicety. It lets you write programs that don&rsquo;t need to be told about the relationships among tables and columns.</p>

<p>There are many ways to do this, I think. But in practice, I think I&rsquo;ve seen only a few customer systems that have a completely consistent, logical naming convention. And there are levels of convenience; some systems have a couple extra rules that make a big difference.</p>

<p>In this post I&rsquo;ll explain the components of my ideal naming conventions.</p>
