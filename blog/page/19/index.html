        <span class="post-date">Wed, Nov 10, 2010</span>
        I&rsquo;ve started an HTML manual for innotop, a &ldquo;top&rdquo; clone for MySQL. It includes screenshots. Right now I only have screenshots for the new U mode, which demonstrates how the User Statistics enhancements in Percona Server can show you which tables and indexes are most used.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Nov 9, 2010</span>
        This month&rsquo;s Maatkit release, which just hit the download servers, contains a new feature for mk-query-digest: Apdex scores. The Apdex performance index is a sensible metric of how satisfactory the response time to a request is. Of all the scientific metrics I&rsquo;ve seen, it&rsquo;s the most practical; and of all the practical ones I&rsquo;ve seen, it&rsquo;s the most scientific.
To use this feature, you need to know what the Apdex threshold means, and you need to know how to configure this in mk-query-digest.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 6, 2010</span>
        I&rsquo;ve just uploaded the new release of innotop to Google Code. Short version of the changelog: works on MySQL 5.1 with the InnoDB plugin; more efficient; supports Percona/MariaDB USER_STATISTICS data; fixes a bunch of small annoying bugs.
Longer version:
2010-11-06: version 1.8.0 Changes: * Don't re-fetch SHOW VARIABLES every iteration; it's too slow on many hosts. * Add a filter to remove EVENT threads in SHOW PROCESSLIST (issue 32). * Add a timestamp to output in -n mode, when -t is specified (issue 37).

        It&rsquo;s been ages since we&rsquo;ve had an update to innotop, or at least, it&rsquo;s been a while since the changes were bundled up and released officially. Barring any bug reports against the trunk code, I&rsquo;m about ready to release more than a year&rsquo;s worth of improvements to it:
 Changes: * Don't re-fetch SHOW VARIABLES every iteration; it's too slow on many hosts. * Add a filter to remove EVENT threads in SHOW PROCESSLIST (issue 32).

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Oct 25, 2010</span>
        You have about 14 more hours to submit session proposals to the O&rsquo;Reilly MySQL conference, which is soliciting sessions about all open-source databases: PostgreSQL, CouchDB, Riak, Hadoop, Firebird, you name it. The last-minute proposals are coming fast and furious, as usual, and we have a great selection to choose from, but we need more!

The real reason is for source material if I ever write a 3rd edition of High Performance MySQL, but hardly a day goes by that I don&rsquo;t look something up. At the very top, I have a section that I want to share with you. It&rsquo;s a list of URLs that are invaluable sources of information and insight.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Oct 19, 2010</span>
        I wish I could go to PGWest this year. A lot of great work has been done on PostgreSQL in the last year and a half. There&rsquo;s a new release with built-in replication, and there are in-place upgrades. That solves two of what I think are its three biggest shortcomings in many large-scale database deployments. (Lack of index-only queries is the third shortcoming.)
PGWest is the first major conference about Postgres since the 9.

        I&rsquo;ve written before about how to get accepted to the conference. We want great technical submissions in a broad variety of topics, for databases well beyond MySQL. I wanted to post a quick list of things that come to my mind as good ways to get voted down or rejected out of hand. In general, I can put it this way: you are being peer-reviewed by presenters and industry experts. You need to write your proposal for the committee as well as for attendees.

This book is well worth reading for anyone interested in MySQL internals. I learned a lot from it. It is well-written and understandable. I cannot say that I&rsquo;m planning to write storage engines or more advanced plugins, but I have a great many ideas how to improve MySQL, and I now understand more clearly which of those are suitable to write as plugins, and of what type of plugin is appropriate.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Oct 7, 2010</span>
        I&rsquo;ve written a tool to profile a process&rsquo;s IO usage. It works by gathering lsof and strace from a process, and then figuring out how the file descriptors, function calls, and filenames are all related to each other. The manual page has examples. I&rsquo;m curious to see how it works for you. Note that it might be a good idea to run this on your development or staging system before you go running it against your production MySQL server &ndash; there are rumors of strace misbehaving on some kernels.

        I had the privilege to meet Neil Gunther and listen to him speak this week at Surge. During his talk, he brought up the point that all measurements are wrong by definition. I thought I knew what he meant, but I was stuck with tunnel vision about floating-point precision and such. I had it all wrong. The real answer is obvious and simple.
The point is that the process of measuring, and therefore the answer that comes out of the measurement process, is imprecise.

        I don&rsquo;t get why companies talk about how many pageviews they get per month. Maybe it is a handy metric when thinking about revenue, but when thinking about performance, it&rsquo;s not a convenient way to measure.
For example, &ldquo;we get 50M page views per month.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s translate that into something useful for an engineer: 20 page views per second. How about 2.5B pageviews per month? Roughly 1000 per second.
Much easier to think about what this means.

I&rsquo;m on the speaker selection committee again this year for the Nth time, and my advice from past years still stands. This year we&rsquo;re also looking for a greater diversity of database products, including other relational databases, NoSQL databases, and ancillary technologies.

        I&rsquo;d like to encourage everyone in the Postgres world to submit session proposals to the 2011 O&rsquo;Reilly MySQL conference. It&rsquo;ll be a different event this year. We&rsquo;re looking for a breadth as well as a depth of proposals on technologies beyond MySQL, and in the speaker selection committee conference calls, PostgreSQL was on the top of the list. I am on the committee. Your high-quality submissions will get a fair and unbiased vote from me, and I think I can speak for the rest of the committee too.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Sep 25, 2010</span>
        Let&rsquo;s suppose that your backup process looks like this: you stop a replication replica, shut down MySQL, and copy away the data directory. Assume that the replica is perfect and has the same data as the master. Nothing is broken, nothing is wrong, everything is working fine. In most cases, this should work, right?
Under what kinds of circumstances will you not get all your data back if you restore the file copy and start MySQL?

        Relational Database Index Design and the Optimizers. By Tapio Lahdenmaki and Mike Leach, Wiley 2005.
I picked this book up on the advice of an Oracle expert, and after one of my colleagues had read it and mentioned it to me. The focus is on how to design indexes that will produce the best performance for various types of queries. It goes into quite a bit of detail on how databases execute specific types of queries, including sort-merge joins and multiple index access, and develops a generic cost model that can be used to produce a quick upper-bound estimate (QUBE) for the execution time of a query.
