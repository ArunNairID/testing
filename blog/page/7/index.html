        <span class="post-date">Sat, May 18, 2013</span>
        Like many others, I don&rsquo;t think that RSS is dead. It&rsquo;s my favorite way to keep up with highly valuable content on the Web. So I&rsquo;m in the market for a replacement for Google Reader, along with millions of others. As I&rsquo;ve evaluated options, I&rsquo;ve had to eliminate some of them because I&rsquo;m not sure they&rsquo;re serious about what they&rsquo;re doing. This post is about my thought process and why I think entrepreneurs should challenge themselves to get serious, and signal that intent, by not building free services.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, May 9, 2013</span>
        I found myself in a, ahem, lively discussion with someone recently. It started when I said &ldquo;there was always something wrong about the daily deals businesses (i.e. Groupon), but I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll teach us what&rsquo;s really needed.&rdquo; Turns out this person ran a local daily-deals site. Oops.
My feeling is that anytime something doesn&rsquo;t take root and grow into a lasting business, there&rsquo;s a lesson to learn. Early social-networking sites weren&rsquo;t quite a match with needs.

        This confuses lots of people, including most recently Todd Hoff of HighScalability fame, who wrote in last week&rsquo;s summary post,
 Have to say, this distinction has never made sense to me: Concurrency is not parallelism: concurrency is the composition of independently executing processes, while parallelism is the simultaneous execution of (possibly related) computations. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 29, 2013</span>
        Last week Tokutek announced that they&rsquo;re open-sourcing their TokuDB storage engine for MySQL. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with TokuDB, it&rsquo;s an ACID-compliant storage engine with a high-performance index technology known as fractal tree indexing. Fractal trees have a number of nice characteristics, but perhaps the most interesting is that they deliver consistently high performance under varying conditions, such as when data grows much larger than memory or is updated frequently. B-tree indexes tend to get fragmented over time, and exhibit a performance cliff when data doesn&rsquo;t fit in memory anymore.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Apr 25, 2013</span>
        Years ago I complained bitterly about MySQL&rsquo;s backwards development and release model, which made guinea pigs out of the paying customers. I think I&rsquo;d be remiss if I didn&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s been fixed for years. And it&rsquo;s really fixed right in my opinion &ndash; much better than what I proposed.
Congratulations, and thanks, to the MySQL team for superhuman software engineering, release engineering, documentation, bug triage and analysis, and doing a million things right &ndash; in other words, making a damn good database, which is hard.

        We&rsquo;re ironing out a kink that&rsquo;s preventing Planet MySQL from aggregating VividCortex&rsquo;s blog feed, so while that&rsquo;s in progress, I&rsquo;ll post a quick note on what we&rsquo;re up to at VividCortex, for the Planet MySQL readers.
VividCortex is a monitoring and analysis product for MySQL, provided as Software-As-A-Service, with agents that run in your systems and report back to our APIs. The agents are super-efficient and non-obtrusive (you&rsquo;ve probably noticed my posts about Go recently).

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Apr 17, 2013</span>
        <p>In 2001 I created a PHP 4 web application framework from scratch as the backbone of a sophisticated application. Back then frameworks weren&rsquo;t cool. Smarty templates were the hotness.</p>

<p>My framework had URL routing, templates with a capable templating syntax similar to mustache, loosely coupled and tightly cohesive object-oriented design, an elegant way to access the database without dumbing it down, and nicely separated business logic and presentation layers &ndash; among many other nice things you find in good frameworks. As the application grew more and more complex, the framework continued to serve well with only occasional enhancements. It&rsquo;s still in use more than a decade later.</p>

<p>I mention this because I think I&rsquo;ve been reasonably capable of designing maintainable systems for a long time. But the so-called MVC paradigm (model, view, controller) has <em>never</em> made sense to me.</p>

        I&rsquo;m scheduled to talk about Go a couple times in the upcoming weeks.
The first is May 4th in Arlington at A Day Of Foster.ly. I&rsquo;ll be a participant in a panel titled Add To Your Programming Toolkit: Languages You Should Know About (Erlang, Clojure, R, Go, etc&hellip;). I&rsquo;m talking about Go, naturally.
The second May 7th is at my local technology guild, the Neon Guild. I&rsquo;m going to be giving a &ldquo;gentle introduction&rdquo; to Go.

        I&rsquo;m really looking forward to Percona Live this year. I will be there, along with Kyle Redinger, my co-founder at VividCortex. I feel that this year the conference has come full circle. 2007 was my first year at the conference, and it was amazing. This year is tremendously exciting for me because it feels like we&rsquo;re back on the 2007 trajectory.
Those were the golden days. Things were a little sad in 2010 and 2011 as the MySQL community tried to figure out the new landscape and O&rsquo;Reilly decided to stop running the event, but then in 2012 we all said &ldquo;we&rsquo;re back!

        High Performance MySQL, 3rd Edition has been selling very well. It&rsquo;s translated into many languages. O&rsquo;Reilly sends me a hard-copy of the translations, and I have a whole section on my bookshelf dedicated to them. It&rsquo;s really satisfying to look at it.
Today I&rsquo;m happy to announce that we&rsquo;re moving forward with a new batch of translations. Demand has been so strong that we want to make the book accessible to as wide an audience as possible.

        I&rsquo;ve been trying out Republic Wireless, a startup that offers very inexpensive wireless service: $19 for unlimited talk, text, and data. In a nutshell: they resell Sprint&rsquo;s network, and you agree to connect to wifi as much as possible; they use the Internet instead of the cell network when you&rsquo;re on wifi. I thought for $19/month it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt to give it a try. After several months, my experience has been that it isn&rsquo;t worth using at all, no matter how cheap it is.

        Last night at the Golang-DC meetup I spoke about building (MySQL) database applications with Go. The meetup was well attended and people were very enthusiastic about Go. I spent a few minutes talking about Go in general, how VividCortex uses Go (we&rsquo;ve built our agents, API servers, and all backend processes with Go), why we like it, some of the nice things it enables like making it easy to build very resilient programs, and then I gave the presentation, which I&rsquo;ve embedded below.

        I really don&rsquo;t like running my database in &ldquo;I Love Garbage&rdquo; mode, so I set the following SQL_MODE:
 STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO, NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO, NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION,NO_ZERO_DATE, NO_ZERO_IN_DATE,ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY
 Guess what WordPress does with that? It doesn&rsquo;t install. If you set the SQL_MODE to empty and install WordPress, then restore the SQL_MODE, WordPress will run, but if you try to create a post you&rsquo;ll see an error page that says &ldquo;You are not allowed to edit this post.

        I am currently finishing some features to make a program highly resilient to occasional crashing bugs. A particular function was found to crash on queries of the form WHERE x IN(NULL), and that crashed the entire program. Now we have a framework for intelligently recovering from arbitrary crashes. I will write more on this in the future, because I think it&rsquo;s a very interesting thing to share.
In this episode, I want to focus on a related topic: how do you test a program that is supposed to be resilient to bugs you can&rsquo;t predict?

        I was a guest on the Food Fight Show last week, along with a bevy of really smart people asking and answering tough questions on fault detection. We didn&rsquo;t talk a lot about MySQL, but given that VividCortex is focusing on MySQL initially, pretty much all of my experience with zero-threshold, zero-configuration fault detection is MySQL-based.
It&rsquo;s a fun conversation with a lot of insights into the industry, what&rsquo;s wrong with current monitoring tools, and where monitoring is going.

        I&rsquo;ve been increasingly questioning the current model of university education in the US. Not only the value for the money, but just the entire notion that it&rsquo;s a good way to learn. I got my Bachelor&rsquo;s in Computer Science from UVA, which has been going through utter facepalm-worthy madness recently. It may be biasing my point of view.
