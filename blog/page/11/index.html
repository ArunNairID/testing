        <span class="post-date">Thu, Aug 23, 2012</span>
        Although not perfect, MySQL replication was probably the killer feature that made MySQL the default database for web applications some time ago. Since then, MySQL replication has been improved greatly, with such notable changes as row-based replication. At the same time, the replication engineering team has made MySQL replication more conservative and less forgiving of foot-gun errors. These have gone a long way towards helping users avoid some of the problems that made replication sometimes drift out of sync with the master copy, sometimes silently.

        Unfortunately, MySQL 5.5 doesn&rsquo;t generate a very good query execution plan for IN() queries against a compound (multi-column) index, such as the following query that should be able to use the 2-column primary key:
 explain select * from tbl1 where (col1, col2) in ( (732727758,102),(732728118,102),(732728298,102),(732728478,102), (732735678,102),(962074728,102),(964153098,102),(2027956818,102), (2034233178,102),(2034233538,102))\G *************************** 1. row *************************** id: 1 select_type: SIMPLE table: tbl1 type: ALL possible_keys: NULL key: NULL key_len: NULL ref: NULL rows: 1379 Extra: Using where  Queries such as this should usually be rewritten to a form such as the following, which accesses only the 10 rows specified instead of scanning the table:

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Aug 21, 2012</span>
        I decided to take another look at MySQL 5.6, and realized that I&rsquo;ve forgotten how many changes this version will have. Each milestone has many improvements, and there have been many milestones, so my memory of the older ones grows hazy. The Fine Manual has the details, but here is my attempt at a quick (and probably incomplete and inaccurate) summary. I&rsquo;ve emphasized a few changes that will make life significantly better for me.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Aug 20, 2012</span>
        For a long time I&rsquo;ve been maintaining a set of scripts inspired by Giuseppe Maxia&rsquo;s MySQL Sandbox, which is a Swiss Army Knife for starting and stopping server instances for jobs such as testing, development, trying out a new version, and so on. My scripts are unpublished, until now. I&rsquo;ve just kept them in my Dropbox&rsquo;s bin folder, which I add to my $PATH.
It&rsquo;s not worth explaining why I use my own scripts, except for saying that I keep dozens or even more MySQL versions unpacked in my home directory at any given time, and I find it a little easier to use these lightweight scripts than the more fully-featured MySQL Sandbox tools.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Aug 15, 2012</span>
        Mail&rsquo;s Mail.app keeps a list of recent recipients, but it doesn&rsquo;t let you export them to a file. You could do as some others on the Internet have suggested and grep the file of addresses for everything that looks like an email address, or you could work with your system instead of against it!
The trick is twofold: knowing where the addresses are stored, and knowing how. They&rsquo;re stored in a file in your user directory, Library/Application Support/AddressBook/MailRecents-v4.

        I&rsquo;m using innotop again every day, for the first time in a few years. I found that I didn&rsquo;t like the tool that the younger and less experienced version of me created. It is very flexible and has the ability to surface a lot of information about MySQL, but not all on one screen. I wanted a &ldquo;single pane of glass&rdquo; health dashboard for the servers I&rsquo;m monitoring, instead of having to look on various screens for important bits of information.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Aug 13, 2012</span>
        Killing long-running idle transactions is a good way to increase the uptime of a MySQL server. This may sound strange, but open transactions will eventually bring the server down, and it is better to hurt a single application than the many that will be hurt when that happens. Long-running idle transactions are usually caused by a programmer mistake or an unexpected condition that causes an application not to be able to do its work.

        If you haven&rsquo;t checked into pt-online-schema-change yet, now&rsquo;s a great time to sign up for my free webinar Thursday, July 19, 3-4 PM EDT. I&rsquo;ll explain and demonstrate the tool, and walk you through everything you need to decide whether it&rsquo;s right for you. If you haven&rsquo;t even heard about pt-online-schema-change yet, the short version is it lets you alter tables in MySQL with practically no downtime at all. This even works for really big tables that might take hours or days to alter &ndash; normally a blocking operation.

        This post isn&rsquo;t about NuoDB, although it was prompted by the phrase &ldquo;100% uptime&rdquo; that I&rsquo;ve seen them use a few times. I want to suggest that people think slightly differently about uptime and availability.
The key to understanding uptime and thinking clearly about it, in my opinion, is to think instead about downtime. Uptime is the absence of downtime. Therefore, focus your attention on reducing downtime through a two-pronged approach.

        As a tool author, I really look forward to working with MySQL 5.6. Many of the improvements will make life significantly easier for Percona Toolkit.
One illustration of this is in figuring out what the optimizer is doing when it plans a statement, and how it intends to use indexes. Compound indexes present challenges in some situations. Many of our tools have extensive checks to try to avoid executing queries that have bad execution plans.

        I took a course on engineering ethics as part of my degree in computer science, and decided that it was very important for me to formally ascribe to a recognized code of conduct. This is not just a principle, but also an important legal matter in today&rsquo;s litigious atmosphere. Court cases have literally been defended by engineers pointing to a code of ethics as their guidelines for actions and decisions.

        I&rsquo;ve been seeing a lot of interest in pt-online-schema-change (nonblocking MySQL schema changes), with a lively discussion on the mailing list (which I think I&rsquo;m not keeping up with&hellip;) and a couple of bug reports filed. I&rsquo;m really interested whether people have tested it rigorously to ensure that it maintains your data integrity. I have done so, and there is a set of tests for it in the codebase, but nothing replaces real-world testing.

        The tools we&rsquo;ve redesigned in Percona Toolkit recently have moved away from a legacy technique for operating on small numbers of rows at a time, towards a more reliable and predictable method. We call the old version &ldquo;chunking&rdquo; and the new version &ldquo;nibbling.&rdquo; Many other MySQL tools I&rsquo;ve seen either operate on entire tables, or use the &ldquo;chunking&rdquo; technique and are exposed to the problems it creates. I&rsquo;ll compare the two briefly to explain the differences.

Yesterday alone I spoke to several people who have been evaluating it for large, mission-critical enterprise deployments. Some new, some to replace existing systems that use standard MySQL replication. What was interesting is that some people said they&rsquo;ve been putting it through its paces for months &ndash; before we even released it as GA.

        I don&rsquo;t think there is a single good-quality MySQL init script for a Unix-like operating system. On Windows, there is the service facility, and I used to write Windows services. Based on that, I believe Windows has a pretty good claim to better reliability for start/stop services with MySQL.
What&rsquo;s wrong with the init scripts? Well, let me count the reasons! Wait, I&rsquo;m out of fingers and toes.
I&rsquo;ll just mention the two annoying ones that I&rsquo;ve run into most recently.

        What are your pet peeves about the tools? I have a lot. For example, pt-table-sync doesn&rsquo;t let me do things I want it to do sometimes (and I know it could be made to do them). Another example: pt-query-digest&rsquo;s tcpdump parser doesn&rsquo;t pay attention to TCP sequence numbers, so sometimes it invents a really long-running query where there isn&rsquo;t one. Post your gripes, big and small, in the comments!
(This blog post is an attempt to do a 37signals approach to prioritizing: the stuff people complain about repeatedly is what you should focus on.
