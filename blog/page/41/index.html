        I&rsquo;m a big fan of pair Networks, my hosting company. Their service has been outstanding; the few times I&rsquo;ve ever had a glitch with my shared hosting, they have been responsive beyond the call of duty and done whatever it takes to fix the issue. I use them to host not only a half-dozen of my own sites, but family and client sites as well, plus some other groups I&rsquo;m involved with.

        I mentioned earlier that I&rsquo;d blog about progress on the book as we go. It&rsquo;s not only progress on the book itself &ndash; I want to write about the process of writing, because I think it&rsquo;s very interesting and relevant to software engineering. I&rsquo;m finding a lot of the work in writing a book comes from some of the same things that make software hard: coordinating work, deciding what should go where, and so on.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Sep 1, 2007</span>
        This release of MySQL Toolkit fixes some minor bugs and adds new functionality to four of the tools. Some of the changes I made were in response to feedback I got at the recent MySQL Camp. I&rsquo;m still working on some of the feature requests, such as daemon-izing certain tools.
For those who requested features for MySQL Query Profiler, the tab-separated format should give you the desired output: no zero rows, and variables are not renamed.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Aug 30, 2007</span>
        We&rsquo;ve begun writing the second edition of the now-classic High Performance MySQL. &ldquo;We&rdquo; means co-authors Arjen Lentz (formerly of MySQL), Baron Schwartz (that&rsquo;s me), and Vadim Tkachenko and Peter Zaitzev, both formerly of MySQL&rsquo;s high-performance team and now partners at Percona, a high-performance MySQL consultancy firm and host of the popular MySQL Performance Blog. Neither of the first edition&rsquo;s authors (Jeremy Zawodny and Derek Balling) is working on this project, but they&rsquo;re with us in spirit, I think.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Aug 29, 2007</span>
        A high-performance application that has producers and consumers of some resource, such as a queue of messages, needs an efficient way to notify the consumers when the producer has inserted into the queue. Polling the queue for changes is not a good option. MySQL&rsquo;s GET_LOCK() and RELEASE_LOCK() functions can provide both mutual exclusivity and notifications.
This post was prompted by a message to the MySQL general emailing list some time ago, but I&rsquo;m finally getting around to actually testing the theoretical solution I mentioned then (I can never just think my way through anything that involves locking and waiting&hellip; I have to test it).

        I&rsquo;m attending the Google Test Automation Conference (GTAC 2007) in Manhattan, New York right now. It&rsquo;s a two-day event hosted by Google, with mostly non-Google speakers.
The conference is by invitation only and very limited; we all had to either have something Google&rsquo;s team of judges thought was good enough to present, or our essays had to impress them (I&rsquo;m not bragging about getting in, I&rsquo;m telling you why I thought the conference would be great).

        I caught most of the second day of MySQL Camp 2007. It was fun and educational as before. The format was a little different than the last Camp; everything was in one room. Google and Proven Scaling provided food. Sessions were loosely organized, to say the least, but that&rsquo;s what an un-conference is all about. When I got there, Ronald Bradford was presenting on MySQL Proxy. Bob Stein, creator of Visibone charts and cheat-sheets, followed with a session seeking feedback to improve the charts.

        I&rsquo;ve just released changes to all tools in MySQL Toolkit. The biggest changes are in MySQL Table Sync, which I&rsquo;m beginning to give sane defaults and options to. Some of the changes are incompatible (but that&rsquo;s what you get with MySQL Table Sync, which is still very rough). I also found and fixed some bugs with MySQL Visual Explain. Thanks to everyone who submitted bug reports.
Note, the formatting overflow in MySQL Query Profiler was not a security vulnerability.

        There is no &ldquo;first&rdquo; or &ldquo;last&rdquo; aggregate function in SQL. Sometimes you can use MIN() or MAX(), but often that won&rsquo;t work either. There are a couple of ways to solve this vexing non-relational problem. Read on to find out how.
First, let&rsquo;s be clear: I am posing a very non-relational problem. This is not about the minimum, maximum, top, most, least or any other relationally valid extreme in the group.

        MySQL AB&rsquo;s recent changes to the Community/Enterprise split have made people go as far as calling the split a failure. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s working well either, but it could be fixed. Here&rsquo;s what I think would make Enterprise a compelling offer.
I&rsquo;d recommend Enterprise if I could If the MySQL Enterprise Server were a good thing, I&rsquo;d recommend it to my consulting clients. I&rsquo;d suggest we start using it at my employer, too.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Aug 4, 2007</span>
        MySQL Replica Delay implements an oft-requested replication feature: the ability to make a replica lag its master, a.k.a scheduling binlog events for some time in the future. This will probably be built into MySQL replication someday, but in the meantime, you can use this tool. A delayed replica is great if disaster strikes and propagates through replication, because it lets you stop the delayed replica before it gets corrupted, restart the replica until just before the offending statement, and recover quickly.

 First, make sure you have run CHANGE MASTER TO and configured the server as a replica.

        If you&rsquo;ve ever wished you could see MySQL&rsquo;s EXPLAIN output formatted as a tree, now you can. MySQL Visual Explain transforms EXPLAIN output into a hierarchical view of the query plan, which is significantly easier to read and understand.
What it does MySQL Visual Explain is a command-line tool, not a Graphical User Interface (GUI). You can use it two ways:
 Give it a query and some connection options, and it will connect and EXPLAIN the query, then show you the result as a tree.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Jul 27, 2007</span>
        Is your MySQL server doing an extra index scan on queries that need to check a key for matches or NULL? It&rsquo;s easy for this to happen accidentally, but it&rsquo;s also easy to fix, especially in MySQL 5.0 and up. Here&rsquo;s how.
If you read the manual page for EXPLAIN, you&rsquo;ll see the ref_or_null &ldquo;join type&rdquo; (I think &ldquo;access type&rdquo; is really a better term) mentioned. If you see this in EXPLAIN, it means MySQL has to search the index for matches, then search again for NULLs.

        I recently bought a Dell Inspiron 1501, which I got a great deal on thanks to the fine people at DealNews. The base system was $449 shipped, and I chose to upgrade the processor to dual AMD64s. But I didn&rsquo;t buy the system that came with Ubuntu pre-installed; for whatever reason, the one that came with Windows offered a special discount (normally the Windows tax for otherwise identical machines appears to be around $150, and I&rsquo;m certainly not going to run Windows).

        I&rsquo;ve just released changes to two of the tools in MySQL Toolkit. MySQL Table Checksum got some convenient functionality to help you recursively check replicas for bad replicated checksum chunks. MySQL Archiver got statistics-gathering functionality to help you optimize your archiving and purging jobs, plus a few important bug fixes.
Changes in MySQL Archiver:
 Made &#8211;time suffix optional. Added &#8211;statistics option to gather and print timing statistics. Added signal handling so mysql-archiver exits cleanly when it can.
