        <span class="post-date">Sun, Jul 16, 2006</span>
        MySQL on GNU/Linux appears to be able to either run multiple processes, or one process and multiple threads. We&rsquo;ve noticed a significant CPU penalty for multiple processes, probably from the context switching overhead. The trouble was, one of our servers wouldn&rsquo;t use threads; it wanted to use multiple processes. This article explains how we got it to use threads instead.
First, we noticed the master server&rsquo;s CPU utilization was higher than the replica&rsquo;s, even though we expected the type of queries running on the replica should have caused it to have around the same CPU utilization as the master.

Linuxthreads and NPTL are part of glibc, the GNU C Library. The recommended threading library for GNU/Linux is now NPTL, not linuxthreads, even though the linuxthreads web page&rsquo;s excerpt in Google says it&rsquo;s &ldquo;The recommended threads package for Linux, also included in glibc 2.

        &ldquo;My code is all in version control,&rdquo; Joe said proudly. &ldquo;Everything is versioned. I&rsquo;ll never lose any work.&rdquo; But then he lost some &ldquo;other&rdquo; code he didn&rsquo;t realize was critical.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Jul 7, 2006</span>
        SQL blind inserts are a common mistake, but they&rsquo;re easily avoided. This article explains what blind inserts are and how to avoid them, as well as dispelling a common misconception about how to avoid them.
What is a blind insert? A blind insert is when an INSERT query doesn&rsquo;t specify which columns receive the inserted data. For instance, this query is a blind insert:
insert into apples select color, price, variety from fruits where type = 'apple'; Notice the query doesn&rsquo;t say what columns are targeted by the INSERT.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jul 4, 2006</span>
        I&rsquo;ve written a lot recently about MySQL index and table structure, primary keys, surrogate keys, and related optimizations. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain how MySQL&rsquo;s index structures enable an extremely important query optimization, and how that differs between storage engines. I&rsquo;ll also show you how to know and predict when the optimization is triggered, how to design tables and queries so it&rsquo;ll be used, and how to avoid defeating it with poor practices.

        MySQL and InnoDB expose lots of information about their internals, but it&rsquo;s hard to gather it all into one place and make sense of it. I&rsquo;ve written a tool to do that, and you are free to download and use it. This article introduces innotop, a powerful text-mode MySQL and InnoDB monitoring tool. It has lots of features, is fast and configurable, and it&rsquo;s easy to use.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Jun 28, 2006</span>
        I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of SQL code that uses an IN clause as a place to put a variable number of parameters, allowing the query to be more flexible. There are several downsides to this technique. This article discusses those downsides and explains how to avoid them.
Introduction I work in a Perl shop at the moment. We use two SQL utility modules from CPAN extensively: Class::DBI (which I&rsquo;ll discuss in another article) and Ima::DBI.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Jun 26, 2006</span>
        Unlike Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice.org 2.0 Calc doesn&rsquo;t have a built-in &ldquo;text to columns&rdquo; feature, which is hard to live without once you&rsquo;re used to it. OpenOffice.org has an extensible add-on architecture, and someone has written a &ldquo;text to columns&rdquo; add-on, but installation may be confusing. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain how to install the add-on.
I hope this feature will be added into the office suite at some point. Oddly, it seems to already be implemented, but not in the way it&rsquo;s needed.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Jun 23, 2006</span>
        MySQL doesn&rsquo;t allow referring to a table that&rsquo;s targeted for update in a FROM clause, which can be frustrating. There&rsquo;s a better way than creating endless temporary tables, though. This article explains how to update a table while selecting from it in a subquery.
The problem Suppose I want to update a table with data from a subquery that refers to the same table. I might want to do this for a variety of reasons, such as trying to populate a table with its own aggregate data (this would require assignment from a grouped subquery), updating one row from another row&rsquo;s data without using non-standard syntax, and so on.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Jun 21, 2006</span>
        I&rsquo;ve recently written about techniques for archiving, purging, and re-indexing huge database tables. These techniques exploit both data structure and usage patterns. In this article I&rsquo;ll develop that theme further, and explain how to write more efficient non-backtracking maintenance jobs when the update and insertion patterns permit.
Motivation In my current employment, I&rsquo;ve been optimizing databases for size, speed, and consistency. As part of my regular monitoring, I checked our master MySQL server for deadlock information and found that a nightly cron job&rsquo;s query had caused other queries to time out or deadlock, then became a deadlock victim itself and died, after loading the server for a long time.

        I have re-licensed some of my scripts under the LGPL, which means you can use them as part of other non-GPL software.
The scripts in question are:
 JavaScript number formatting JavaScript date/time formatting and parsing JavaScript date/time chooser for HTML documents JavaScript &ldquo;combo box&rdquo; simulation  Why the change? I&rsquo;ve always released my work under the GPL, but now that I&rsquo;m writing and making available smaller scripts that might be used as part of a larger software system, the GPL isn&rsquo;t as appropriate, because of the licensing requirements it places on the rest of the systems with which the scripts may be used.

        This article is a quick pointer on MySQL&rsquo;s three techniques for UPSERT (update/insert) or MERGE queries. I&rsquo;ve written about this before, but since SQL 2003 has a MERGE statement (which Oracle and DB2 support), many people are asking for similar functionality in MySQL without realizing it already exists. I hope this article helps you find what you need.
The three tools are
 REPLACE INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE .

        There is a bug in MySQL that causes an UPDATE to fail with a unique index violation, even though the statement doesn&rsquo;t create duplicate values. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain when this bug can happen, and how to work around it.
The bug This is easiest to demonstrate with SQL:
create table t (i int not null primary key); insert into t(i) values (1), (2), (3), (4); update t set i = i + 1; -- ERROR 1062 (23000): Duplicate entry '2' for key 1 The bug is caused by MySQL&rsquo;s method of updating the values.

        In recent articles I explained how I&rsquo;ve optimized queries against large datasets at my current employer, and how I&rsquo;ve written efficient archiving and purging jobs to trim the tables down to a manageable size. This article explains how I re-indexed some of those tables without taking the server offline.
The technique I used is suitable for when a table has gotten &ldquo;too fat to exercise.&rdquo; In other words, the table is in critical condition, but that very condition makes it hard to do anything with the table, much less re-index or re-arrange the data.

LEFT() is faster than DATE(). To prove this, I inserted two million un-indexed sequential values into a table and selected the minimum and maximum values. Both queries are table scans, so it does read through all the records. The table below lists the time in seconds for MAX() on my computer.
