        <span class="post-date">Sun, Jun 4, 2006</span>
        I&rsquo;m a big fan of meta-data stored in the database. I love having a table that records arbitrary data about data. In fact, such a table can even be used to store meta-data about itself. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain how to use meta-data to define a sort order for both itself and the data to which it&rsquo;s related.
I&rsquo;ve mentioned an online cemetery database several times. One of the great things about this project is it doesn&rsquo;t need custom-designed interfaces for every view on the data; the interfaces can be automatically generated.

        <span class="post-date">Fri, Jun 2, 2006</span>
        There&rsquo;s been much discussion about canonicalizing URIs for search engines and other purposes. Here&rsquo;s a possibility: instead of specifying the exact canonical URI for a page, just indicate which parts of it are important.
The issue usually comes up with regards to product pages in e-commerce, for example. Many e-commerce sites use query strings to specify the product to display. This is not a problem, because search engines like Google usually pay attention to several query string parameters.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, May 31, 2006</span>
        In MySQL, privileges are stored in tables in the mysql database, so if I have UPDATE privileges to that database, it&rsquo;s easy to update my own privileges. For an example of what the desired privileges should be, run the following query:
select * from user where User='root'; The Grant_priv column is what I&rsquo;m interested in. I just update that value to &lsquo;Y&rsquo; for my user, execute FLUSH PRIVILEGES, log out, and log back in.

        I want to follow up on my earlier article about how to do CAPTCHAs without images, for accessibility and usability. In that article I hoped my simple scheme would deter dumb robots, cutting down on the bulk of the comment spam I was getting.
It did cut out the comment spam &ndash; for a while. After a while, though, I started to get some spam again. I could see the spammer was either doing it manually, or had figured out that my form submission included the ID of the question I&rsquo;d asked (wow, you spammers sure are smart).

        In this article I&rsquo;ll show several ways to emulate a FULL OUTER join on a RDBMS that doesn&rsquo;t support it, as is the case with even the most recent versions of MySQL. This useful query is surprisingly tricky to get right.
Introduction A standard SQL FULL OUTER join is like a LEFT or RIGHT join, except that it includes all rows from both tables, matching them where possible and filling in with NULLs where there is no match.

        This article gives an overview of the Linux kernel&rsquo;s CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC feature, which stores in the kernel the config file used to build it.
What it is Linux can store a gzip-compressed kernel configuration file in the kernel itself, and make it available when the kernel is booted. This is very useful for determining how the kernel was configured when it was built. It makes it possible to re-create a kernel without having the configuration saved separately, makes it easier to debug problems with a kernel, and so forth.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, May 20, 2006</span>
        Most operating systems have an auto-mount feature to detect and mount devices, such as USB flash drives, when they&rsquo;re plugged in. GNU/Linux is no exception. It&rsquo;s easy to install and just as easy to use. In this article I&rsquo;ll show you how to get auto-mounting without changing /etc/fstab, writing udev rules, or installing a huge desktop environment such as Gnome or KDE.
There&rsquo;s more than one way to do it There are lots of ways to get things auto-mounted.

If you&rsquo;re new to SQL and have a hard time understanding this article, I encourage you to keep puzzling over it until the light comes on. I had to do that myself (and I&rsquo;ve had to think hard about it to write this article), and I&rsquo;ve seen a number of people learn SQL.

        Unit testing can help make code much more flexible by giving an unambigous, yes-or-no answer about whether the code is right. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain an important principle for making unit tests most useful for refactoring: Test the behavior, not the implementation.
This may not seem important at first glance, but consider what happens when the implementation is tested. If the implementation changes, the test suite breaks! That makes correct refactoring impossible.

First, the symptoms:
delete a from db1.t1 as a inner join db1.t2 as b on a.c1 = b.c1; ERROR 1109: Unknown table 'b' in MULTI DELETE This will happen if the following are true:
 No database is selected or one of the tables is not in the current database The tables are aliased  According the the MySQL documentation,

        InnoDB is a special case among MySQL storage engines because they have clustered indexes, which means surrogate keys have to be treated differently in InnoDB. This article gives a quick overview of clustered indexes, and explains why they make it even more important to do careful analysis before making decisions about surrogate keys on InnoDB tables.
Overview of clustered indexes in MySQL A clustered index is just like any other index, except the index holds the data itself, in index order.

        This is the second article in a two-part series on understanding and using advanced features in HTML tables. In the first part I explained a few of the simpler features. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain how the axis attribute allows an author to encode multi-dimensional data into two-dimensional tables, and to encode relational data into hierarchical tables.
Encoding multiple dimensions There are lots of places where data has more than two dimensions &ndash; or where I might want to break data apart into more than two dimensions.

        After a long break for a bunch of SQL posts, I&rsquo;m continuing to explain how to push HTML tables to their limits. In this series I discuss the seldom-used features many people don&rsquo;t know exist in HTML tables, such as axes and the headers attribute. These are the tools you need to really use tables to their full power, instead of shoving some square-peg data into a round-hole table. Granted, many times you don&rsquo;t need these features, but when you do, they&rsquo;re like the &ldquo;ludicrous speed&rdquo; lever on your spaceship: nothing else will do.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, May 4, 2006</span>
        My co-worker John taught me a useful technique to let a program choose an optimal wait time when polling a resource. In the post couple of years, I&rsquo;ve used it many times. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain the technique and give some examples of when to use it (and when not to use it!).
The technique Here is pseudo-code for a process that needs to poll a resource:
wait = 128; minWait = 1; maxWait = 32768; didSomething = false; while (true) { didSomething = false; // Do stuff till done do { stuffToDo = pollResource(); if (stuffToDo) { doStuff(stuffToDo); didSomething = true; } } while (stuffToDo); // Decide how long to wait if (didSomething) { wait = max(minWait, wait / 2); } else { wait = min(maxWait, wait * 2); } // Wait sleep(wait); } This code is an infinite loop that polls something, does what needs to be done, then sleeps a varying amount of time.
