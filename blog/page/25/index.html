        <span class="post-date">Mon, Nov 16, 2009</span>
        My favorite quote from last weekend&rsquo;s OpenSQL Camp was something like this: &ldquo;Calling a database NoSQL is like calling a car horseless. It isn&rsquo;t descriptive.&rdquo; I think the term NoSQL really needs to die. It is meaningless, divisive, overly broad, and just generally unhelpful.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 14, 2009</span>
        Last week I attended the Enterprise LAMP Summit and Camp in Nashville, Tennessee. I enjoyed the event and met or reconnected with a lot of great people. I was glad to be able to spend time with some folks from the Postgres community. My own sessions focused on MySQL.
During the Summit I tried to help people understand how to think about performance, and made the case that the Percona versions of the MySQL server are not only the highest-performance available, but uniquely provide the instrumentation necessary to follow a disciplined performance optimization process such as Method R or Goal-Driven Performance Optimization.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 14, 2009</span>
        You used to use mk-query-digest to aggregate and report on MySQL&rsquo;s slow query log. Then it got the ability to grab query events from polling SHOW PROCESSLIST. Next we thought, really, how hard can it be to implement the libmysql wire protocol, so we can sniff TCP packets? &hellip; it&rsquo;s hard, but not that hard as it turns out. But why stop there, why not implement memcached protocol too? I think you can see where this is headed.

        My Dell laptop&rsquo;s battery died (slowly). Thinking I was being clever, I bought a replacement part from a name brand instead of Dell. That one died, too, but much more spectacularly. If I buy another battery, this time from Dell, I&rsquo;ll have spent more on batteries than on the laptop.
This stinks. It&rsquo;s all around us, though: refrigerators that have non-serviceable compressors, so when they wear out you have to get a new refrigerator.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Nov 1, 2009</span>
        MySQL Proxy is a really neat tool. I remember a few years back when I first saw Jan talking about it. Back in those days it was significantly different than it is now, but the concept remains the same: direct your database traffic through a man-in-the-middle. Chris Calender&rsquo;s post on capturing erroneous queries with MySQL Proxy shows one use for Proxy. But wait. MySQL Proxy is just inspecting the MySQL protocol.

        I&rsquo;ve released version 1.1.4 of my improved Cacti templates. Unlike the prior release, which was solely bug fixes, this one includes new graphs in the MySQL template. Some of the graphs are of data that&rsquo;s exposed in standard MySQL versions, but some of it is available only in Percona&rsquo;s high-performance builds of the MySQL database server. If you don&rsquo;t have a Percona build, those graphs will just contain nothing, but there is no detrimental effect.

        Ever seen this in SHOW INNODB STATUS and wondered what it means?
 ------------------------------------- INSERT BUFFER AND ADAPTIVE HASH INDEX ------------------------------------- Ibuf: size 1, free list len 4634, seg size 4636,  I&rsquo;ve never been quite sure, and Peter didn&rsquo;t really clarify things himself, so I took a look at the source. If I&rsquo;m not mistaken, the seg size is really one more than the number of records the insert buffer can hold, the free list length is the number that aren&rsquo;t in use, and the size is just seg_size - (1 + free_list_len).

        I&rsquo;ve just released version 1.1.3 of the Cacti templates I wrote for MySQL. This is a bug-fix release only, and affects only ss_get_mysql_stats.php. To upgrade from the previous release, upgrade ss_get_mysql_stats.php. Don&rsquo;t forget to save and restore your configuration options, if any. (Note that there is a feature to help with this: you can keep configuration options in ss_get_mysql_stats.php.cnf to avoid making them in ss_get_mysql_stats.php.)

        Maatkit&rsquo;s mk-loadavg tool is a helpful way to gather information about infrequent conditions on your database server (or any other server, really). We wrote it at Percona to help with those repeated cases of things like &ldquo;every two weeks, my database stops processing queries for 30 seconds, but it&rsquo;s not locked up and during this time there is nothing happening.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s pretty much impossible to catch in action, and these conditions can take months to resolve without the aid of good tools.

The symptoms were weird; I&rsquo;m not sure I understand fully what happened, but some of the graphs were OK and some had only part of the data they were supposed to. Some graphs would have one data element as usual, and others would be nan (not a number).

        I wrote a while ago about how mext works &ndash; it runs &ldquo;mysqladmin extended-status&rdquo; and formats it nicely. But what if you want to use it to format saved output that you&rsquo;ve put into a file? It&rsquo;s actually very easy. You can tell it what command-line to run to generate its input. By default you are probably going to tell it to run &ldquo;mysqladmin ext -ri10&#8243; or something like that, but you can just as easily make it run &ldquo;cat my-saved-output&rdquo;.
