        The comments on my article how to find duplicate rows with SQL made me realize I was simplifying things too much. In particular, I really glossed over the &ldquo;how to delete duplicate rows&rdquo; section, which I should have explained in more detail. I hope this article will remedy the omissions.
Update: I&rsquo;ve now written another article on deleting duplicates when you have no primary key.
What&rsquo;s wrong with what I wrote?

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Oct 9, 2006</span>
        This article shows how to find duplicated rows in a database table. This is a very common beginner question. The basic technique is straightforward. I&rsquo;ll also show some variations, such as how to find &ldquo;duplicates in two columns&rdquo; (a recent question on the #mysql IRC channel).
How to find duplicated rows The first step is to define what exactly makes a row a duplicate of another row. Most of the time this is easy: they have the same value in some column.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Oct 1, 2006</span>
        I&rsquo;ve made more improvements to the duplicate index checker. I addressed a MySQL bug Roland Bouman mentioned to me, added more tests to the suite, and made changes so it considers more types of indexes now (HASH, BTREE, SPATIAL). I made no changes to the foreign key checking.
The bug Roland mentioned is a problem with SHOW CREATE TABLE that causes MySQL to show an index as type HASH when it&rsquo;s really a BTREE.

        Version 0.1.152 of innotop is a small maintenance and bug-fix release. I found some more ways to make it deal with garbage input without crashing. Of course, that means it&rsquo;s harder to find errors because it doesn&rsquo;t complain and let me know they exist, but that&rsquo;s what you are for :-)
I&rsquo;m also making a sort of homepage for it. I just don&rsquo;t have much time to put into these things right now, so a &ldquo;real&rdquo; homepage may be a long time off, I don&rsquo;t know.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Sep 26, 2006</span>
        Do you know the fine details of MySQL&rsquo;s transactional error handling with the InnoDB storage engine? If you&rsquo;re writing transactional SQL, you need to be prepared to handle errors appropriately, and to do that, you need to know how MySQL handles them. This article introduces you to the topic.
How InnoDB differs from other engines When a MySQL query has an error in a non-transactional storage engine, such as MyISAM, the results are anybody&rsquo;s guess.

        I&rsquo;ve bought plane tickets to the upcoming MySQL Camp in November. This is looking like a very fun time, with lots of community members, MySQL employees, and Google developers attending. It&rsquo;s an &ldquo;un-conference,&rdquo; which means there is no set schedule, and it&rsquo;s up to us to make out of the event whatever we wish it to be. If you&rsquo;ve been reading my articles or using my tools, is there anything you&rsquo;d like me to present on?

        I was poking around in the MySQL source code, namely in sql/sql_yacc.yy, and found a hidden treat: there&rsquo;s a SHOW COLUMN TYPES command. It&rsquo;s fun to read source code!
The command is undocumented, but does work. It returns just two rows, which give information about TINYINT and TINYINT UNSIGNED. And it has been in the source for a long time, certainly since version 4.1.21. There&rsquo;s even a status counter for it in the SHOW STATUS command: Com_show_column_types.

        What was a 5-minute script has become a bigger project. I&rsquo;ve made more improvements to the duplicate index checker. Soon it will require product activation and have security vulnerabilities every week. Seriously: this is the third iteration, and three strikes and you automate, so I automated. I have a test suite now (your contributions welcome), and I addressed two shortcomings readers pointed out in comments on the original article. You now get better foreign key checking, and FULLTEXT indexes are ignored.

        I got bitten by an implicit type conversion with MySQL recently. This article is about avoiding implicit type conversions, and the weird places you might find them.
Introduction Here&rsquo;s the setup: I was trying to select every day in the current month. Have you read my article about how stringifying dates is faster than comparing them as dates? At the time I wrote this query, I was experimenting with such things after seeing my co-workers do it a lot, for example, taking the left ten characters of a timestamp column to get the date part of it.

        I&rsquo;ve just improved the MySQL duplicate index checker I whipped together a few days ago. As I guessed, my hasty coding left some things to be desired. I&rsquo;ve fixed some bugs, added support for finding duplicate foreign keys, and switched to a command-line parsing library that comes standard with Perl, so it&rsquo;s more convenient to run without needing to fetch modules from CPAN.
You can download it from the original article.

        Version 0.1.149 of the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor is a major upgrade. As of this version I&rsquo;m declaring innotop &ldquo;stable,&rdquo; meaning I&rsquo;ve put some work into making it deal with unexpected input. It should be very resistant to any sort of crash now.
I originally made it intolerant of unexpected input, because the output of SHOW INNODB STATUS varies so much and was never designed for parsability. Making it die when it couldn&rsquo;t parse something let me know there was a problem, but it caused many of you pain when you couldn&rsquo;t keep it running reliably.

        Glom is an interesting graphical database front-end I&rsquo;ve been meaning to try out for some time. Someone asked about graphical database front-ends on the #mysql IRC channel recently, and that prompted me to install Glom and learn how to use it. My overall impressions? It lands squarely in the middle of its target audience&rsquo;s needs, but still has a quirk here and there. With a bit of polish it will be a fine product, and it&rsquo;s already a winner over Microsoft Access and Filemaker, two similar programs with which you might be familiar.

        Microformats are getting some attention from the group of people who are clueful about the semantic web, but some people are not yet convinced they&rsquo;re useful. While microformats aren&rsquo;t as robust and complex as some more fully-featured technologies, some apparent limitations are actually possible to overcome, but with different methods than might be expected. In this article I&rsquo;ll address some common concerns about microformats, and explain how they are either solvable or already solved.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Aug 28, 2006</span>
        Peter Zaitsev over at the excellent MySQL Performance Blog recently wrote an article on duplicated and redundant indexes &ndash; any indexes which cover exactly the same columns as another index, or cover a leftmost prefix of another index. While there are subtleties, such as FULLTEXT indexes not being the same as non-FULLTEXT, for the most part this is sufficient criteria to raise possible duplicates to a DBA&rsquo;s attention. I opened my big mouth in the comments and said I could write a quick Perl script to discover possible offenders in just a few lines of code.

The single most important thing you can do is keep your transactions as small as possible.

        MySQL issues a cryptic error message, &ldquo;Error on rename,&rdquo; when you try to alter a table in such a way that it would break a foreign key constraint:
create table test1(a int not null primary key)engine=innodb; create table test2(a int not null, foreign key(a) references test1 (a)) engine=innodb; alter table test2 modify a smallint not null; ERROR 1025 (HY000): Error on rename of './test/#sql-2fa8_1' to './test/test2' (errno: 150) This happens because ALTER TABLE really works by making a copy of the table, then renaming to move the old table out of the way and move the new table into its place.

        I&rsquo;ve released version 0.1.146 of the innotop MySQL and InnoDB monitor.
I re-arranged some information to be more compact and readable in this version, but there isn&rsquo;t really much new functionality. This is mostly a bug-fix release to prevent crashes when innotop encounters unexpected information, or doesn&rsquo;t find some information it expects to exist. It&rsquo;s still very much beta software, so it may die unexpectedly. See this article about what information I need to debug and fix crashes.

I finished that article with a sketch of some basics to provide row-level read, write, and delete access control.
