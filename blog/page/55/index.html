        <span class="post-date">Wed, Sep 28, 2005</span>
        Comments are one of the most abused programming techniques. I know I&rsquo;m not the first to say this, but it bears repeating. There are hundreds of ways to misuse comments, and very few ways to use them correctly. In this article I&rsquo;ll pick on just one way to misuse them: fustian pontificating.
Albert Einstein said something like &ldquo;things should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler&rdquo; (it&rsquo;s unclear what he actually said, so I&rsquo;m paraphrasing).

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Sep 28, 2005</span>
        In this article I&rsquo;ll show you how to group data into defined buckets, putting everything that doesn&rsquo;t fit into the defined buckets into a catch-all bucket.
For example, suppose my data is online ads, and I store each ad&rsquo;s current position in an integer column. The ads compete against ads from other advertisers, and the top bidder gets position 1. I want to count how many ads are in positions 1 through 5, with 6 through infinity lumped together.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Sep 28, 2005</span>
        MySQL 4.1 adds a number of new aggregate functions, among them GROUP_CONCAT. Earlier versions require you to build and compile the function as a C++ extension, which I&rsquo;m told is easy. However, that is usually not possible in a shared hosting environment.
It is possible to use user variables to write some queries without GROUP_CONCAT. The key is to understand how MySQL implements selects. As the following example shows, it really loops through each row one at a time, evaluating the expression for each.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Sep 28, 2005</span>
        Is it better to name SQL tables with singular or plural names? In my opinion, the most important thing to do is pick one and stick to it. Programmers will always argue about singular vs. plural, and it is possible to make a valid case for both.
My strong preference is singular. The name is the table name; it is not the name of the tuples. A bag does not become a &ldquo;bags&rdquo; when you put apples in it.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Sep 28, 2005</span>
        Bitwise arithmetic can be very useful, and not just for C and graphics programmers, but for all types of programming tasks. Those who use it frequently enough become fluent. Here I present a few tips. As I think of more, I will add them here.
Signed versus unsigned Remember numbers can be signed or unsigned. Know the difference, and know the arithmetic for both. For example, when checking to see if a certain bit is set:

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Sep 27, 2005</span>
        If your RDBMS does not support the ROW_NUMBER function, it is still possible to write some queries without it. ROW_NUMBER operates over a partition of the result set, and returns a number for each row in a partition (it is possible to specify numbering schemes besides consecutive integers).
Ranking and windowing functions are available in Microsoft SQL Server 2005, and are part of the newer SQL standards. I expect it will be some time before MySQL implements them.

        Simpler is often better. The ability to decide quickly between two equivalent solutions is what sets expert programmers apart. It has been demonstrated over and over again that a) there is more than a tenfold difference in productivity between programmers, and b) there is absolutely zero correlation between speed and quality in programming. Choosing the best solution to a problem is an acquired skill that takes time and experience, but it takes something more as well: a certain mental attitude.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Sep 26, 2005</span>
        Many people are confused by SQL terminology, particularly by subqueries and derived tables, and use the terms incorrectly. In fact the official terminology is defined very specifically. It is a good idea to use the right language. Not only does it foster clear understanding, but among people who know the difference, it helps create a good impression of competence and attention to detail.
The official standard defines a derived table as follows:[1]

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Sep 25, 2005</span>
        If necessary, INSERT IF NOT EXISTS queries can be written in a single atomic statement, eliminating the need for a transaction, and without violating standards. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain several ways to write such queries in a platform-independent way.
Motivation Suppose a table of urls has a unique index on the url:
create table urls(url varchar(200) primary key); Now suppose I want to insert a row in a single statement, without using a transaction, and I only want the row to get inserted if the url isn&rsquo;t already in the table.

        There is usually more than one way to write a given query, but not all ways are created equal. Some mathematically equivalent queries can have drastically different performance. This article examines one of the motivations for inventing LEFT OUTER join and including it in the SQL standard: improved performance through exclusion joins.
LEFT OUTER join syntax was added to the SQL-92 standard specifically to address certain queries that had only been possible with NOT IN subqueries.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Sep 22, 2005</span>
        MySQL does not support UNION prior to version 4.0.0, but it is possible to write a UNION with a mutex table and LEFT OUTER JOIN. As an example, UNION these tables together:
create table colors ( title varchar(20) ); create table flavors( title varchar(20) ); insert into colors values ('blue'), ('green'); insert into flavors values ('vanilla'), ('chocolate'); The trick is to LEFT OUTER join such that the values from one table do not get included in the same row with values from other tables, then COALESCE the values to select the (only) non-NULL value from each row.

        <span class="post-date">Thu, Sep 22, 2005</span>
        A &ldquo;mutex&rdquo; table is a clever trick that allows joining tables while keeping them independent of each other in a query. This property allows interesting queries that are not otherwise possible. It is especially useful in earlier versions of MySQL, where it can be used to simulate some unsupported queries such as UNION and derived tables in the FROM clause.
My standard mutex table is as follows:
create table mutex( i int not null primary key ); insert into mutex(i) values (0), (1); I typically use the mutex table as the leftmost table of LEFT OUTER JOIN queries.

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Sep 21, 2005</span>
        Some queries that seemingly require the use of subqueries in the FROM clause (commonly called derived tables) can be written without them. This is useful for earlier versions of MySQL, which do not support subqueries. In this article I&rsquo;ll explain how to get the effect of subqueries without actually using them.
The basic principle that makes this work is this: a subquery in the FROM clause really works like an anonymous view, and can be accomplished as joins to base tables, as long as the joins don&rsquo;t interact.
