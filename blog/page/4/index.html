        <span class="post-date">Sun, May 4, 2014</span>
        <p>I spoke at <a href="http://gophercon.com/">Gophercon</a> last week in Denver, and it was one of the best
conferences I&rsquo;ve attended. I can&rsquo;t remember learning so much and meeting so many
great people in years. I have page after page of notes in my notebook, many of
which I&rsquo;ve yet to follow up on. The conference prompted a burst of learning and
a flurry of creativity for me, as well as a huge list of things to study
further.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/05/gophercon.png" alt="Gophercon" /></p>

<p>In no particular order, here are some of the many highlights for me:</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Apr 29, 2014</span>
        If you&rsquo;re interested in Google&rsquo;s Go programming language, perhaps you aren&rsquo;t sure what drivers to use for MySQL. The good news is there are excellent drivers for MySQL.
There are several opensource ones on GitHub and elsewhere, but the driver I recommend is https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql/. Why?
 It is pure Go, not a wrapper around a C library, and is liberally licensed. It is high performance. A lot of work has gone into making it avoid allocations and consume minimal CPU.

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 28, 2014</span>
        <p>I was listening to a conversation recently and heard an experienced engineer express an interesting point of view on joins and key-value databases. I don&rsquo;t entirely agree with it. Here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/04/loc.jpg" alt="Library Of Congress" /></p>

<p>First, the opinion. If I may paraphrase, the discussion was something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>With experience in building distributed systems, one learns to avoid JOIN.</li>
<li>Therefore, much of the work of JOIN is done in the application instead of the database.</li>
<li>Access to the database is usually reduced to simple primary-key lookups.</li>
<li>Therefore, a key-value store is as good a choice as a relational database.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m simplifying, because the speaker actually suggested that MySQL makes a really good database for primary-key lookups as well.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 21, 2014</span>
        <p>Have you heard of <em>sharding</em> a database? Of course you have. Do you know where
the term comes from? Someone asked me this at a cocktail party recently. I gave
it my best shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The earliest I remember was Google engineers using it to describe the
architecture of some things,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That would have been about 2006.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope. Much earlier than that,&rdquo; said my new friend.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/04/ultima.jpg" alt="ultima" /></p>

<p>I pondered. &ldquo;Well, I guess there was the famous LiveJournal architecture
article about MySQL. That was, I dunno, 2003?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The person then told me the following history. I can neither
confirm nor deny it; what do you know about it?</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve used Vim for as long as I can remember, but when I started to work with Go
at VividCortex, for some reason I started to use Sublime Text instead. It does
make a very nice GUI-based editor, but I never felt that it was as powerful as
Vim.</p>

<p>Ever notice how the Vim logo looks a little like Superman&rsquo;s logo? No? Squint a
little harder, then.</p>

        Embedded below are slides for the two talks I gave at Percona Live. The first one is titled knowing the unknowable. It illustrates the special regression technique we developed at VividCortex for computing the amount of CPU, IO, or other resources a query uses within MySQL.
 The second one is on building MySQL database applications with Go.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Apr 12, 2014</span>
        I was interested to see the announcement of a MySQL replication synchronization checker utility from Oracle recently. Readers may know that I spent years working on this problem. The tool is now known as pt-table-checksum in Percona Toolkit, but the original work started in 2006. I would say that I personally have spent at least 6 months working on that; adding up all the other Percona Toolkit developers, there might be several man-years of work invested.

        I had a great time at Percona Live. I think this was the best MySQL conference I&rsquo;ve ever been to. (The food was excellent too. The fastest way to a man&rsquo;s heart is through his stomach.)
The talks I attended were very good. Jay Janssen&rsquo;s tutorial on Percona XtraDB Cluster was impressive. I can&rsquo;t imagine how much time he must have spent preparing for that.
I was very happy that Oracle, MariaDB, and WebScaleSQL had a strong presence, too.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Mar 2, 2014</span>
        <p>Time-series databases are of particular interest to me these days. Not only is
<a href="https://vividcortex.com/">VividCortex</a> working with large-scale time-series
data, but it&rsquo;s a growing trend in the technology world in general. What&rsquo;s
perhaps most surprising is the dearth of native time-series databases, either
commercial or opensource.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/03/alice.jpg" alt="No Time to Say Hello" /></p>

<h3 id="the-world-is-time-series">The World is Time-Series</h3>

<p>The data we gather is increasingly timestamped and dealt with in time-series
ways. For the last 10 years, I&rsquo;ve worked with &ldquo;roll-up&rdquo; or &ldquo;summary&rdquo; tables
almost constantly. I built, and saw others build, the same types of solutions
over and over. For example, I probably consulted with over a dozen companies who
do search-engine marketing and advertising. Cost tables are a given, and there&rsquo;s
usually cost-per-ad-per-day and half a dozen other summary tables. In my case I
saw these things in the MySQL context, but you can pick your technology and
someone&rsquo;s trying to do time-series tasks on top of it.</p>

        <p>I consider myself a very slow adopter with regard to tablets. I&rsquo;m too picky. I
think the iPad is inconveniently large, and there are a lot of devices that have
the same screen size, which eliminated many of the popular ones from my
consideration. Many of the devices out there are 7-inch screens, and that&rsquo;s too
<em>small</em>.  A while ago I <a href="/blog/2011/06/04/using-the-nook-color-as-a-full-featured-android-tablet/">tried</a> using a 7-inch device but after a while I
stopped using it. Now I&rsquo;ve found a tablet I really like.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Wed, Feb 26, 2014</span>
        <p>Sometimes people&rsquo;s perspective can be so interesting. I mean this with
absolutely no irony. Josh Berkus wrote recently in a post about upcoming <a href="http://www.databasesoup.com/2014/02/why-hstore2jsonb-is-most-important.html">JSON
improvements in PostgreSQL 9.4</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>MySQL largely rose on the success of PHP, and it fell as PHP became
marginalized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an aside in the blog post, off-topic. But it&rsquo;s
interesting to discuss because it reveals the completely different things people
see when they look at something. It&rsquo;s like the proverbial story about the blind
men describing an elephant. We have such a variety of perceptions.</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/02/kaleidoscope.jpg" alt="Elephant" /></p>

<p>This post, by the way, is not yet another flame war about MySQL versus
PostgreSQL. To the contrary, it is very important for MySQL users and
community members to understand that there are other communities who do not
share the same assumptions, values, and beliefs at all. In my experience, many
arguments about things like MySQL versus PostgreSQL result from people (or
groups of people) holding such differences but being unaware of them, and
therefore misinterpreting words and actions from a group who doesn&rsquo;t share the
same worldview, believing them to be dishonest, irrational, or hostile.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve learned to be very careful about making or accepting such offers or
requests, and I&rsquo;d like to share my current thoughts about that with you, because

        In the last few years, there&rsquo;s been a lot of discussion about alerts in the circles I move in. There&rsquo;s general agreement that a lot of tools don&rsquo;t provide good alerting mechanisms, including problems such as unclear alerts, alerts that can&rsquo;t be acted upon, and alerts that lack context.
Yesterday and today at the Strata conference, my phone and lots of phones around me started blaring klaxon sounds. When I looked at my phone, I saw something like this (the screenshot is from a later update, but otherwise similar):

But then I found that Jason Davies already wrote a great article about it. Play with his live demo. I was able to get a false positive through luck in a few keystrokes: add alice, bob, and carol to the filter, then test the filter for candiceaklda.

        I am interested in compiling a list of techniques to generate fake time-series data that looks and behaves realistically. The goal is to make a mock API for developers to work against, without needing bulky sets of real data, which are annoying to deal with, especially as things change and new types of data are needed.
To achieve this, I think several specific things need to be addressed:
 What common classes or categories of time-series data are there?

The first is a walk-through of everything I&rsquo;ve learned over the last 18 months writing large-scale MySQL-backed applications with Google&rsquo;s Go language. The second is about using statistical techniques to find out things you can&rsquo;t even measure, such as how much CPU a query really causes MySQL to use.

friends in <a href="http://crossfitcharlottesville.com/">CrossFit Charlottesville</a>, completely changed my level of fitness
and many key indicators of health such as my hemoglobin A1C and vitamin D
levels, am stronger than I&rsquo;ve ever been, feel great, and now my wife does
CrossFit too. It&rsquo;s fantastic. It&rsquo;s community, fun, health, fitness. It&rsquo;s the
antidote to the boring gyms I forced myself to go to for years and hated every
minute.</p>

<p>But there is a fringe element in CrossFit, which unfortunately looks mainstream
to some who don&rsquo;t really have enough context to judge. From the outside,
CrossFit can look almost cult-like. It&rsquo;s easy to get an impression of people
doing dangerous things with little caution or training. To hear people talk
about it, everyone in CrossFit works out insanely until they vomit, pushing
themselves until their muscles break down and vital organs go into failure
modes.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 18, 2014</span>
        <p>Do you know how to tune a guitar? I mean, do you <em>really</em> know how to tune a
guitar?</p>

<p><img src="/media/2014/01/guitar-tuning.jpg" alt="Guitar Closeup" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve met very few people who do. Most people pick some notes, crank the tuners,
play some chords, and endlessly fidget back and forth until they either get
something that doesn&rsquo;t sound awful to their ears, or they give up. I can&rsquo;t
recall ever seeing a professional musician look like a tuning pro on stage,
either. This really ought to be embarrassing to someone who makes music for a
career.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a secret to tuning an instrument. Very few people seem to know it. It&rsquo;s
surprisingly simple, it isn&rsquo;t at all what you might expect, and it makes it easy
and quick to tune an instrument <em>accurately</em> without guesswork. However, even
though it&rsquo;s simple and logical, it is difficult and subtle at first, and
requires training your ear. This is a neurological, physical, and mental process
that takes some time and practice. It does <em>not</em> require &ldquo;perfect pitch,&rdquo;
however.</p>

<p>In this blog post I&rsquo;ll explain how it works. There&rsquo;s a surprising amount of
depth to it, which appeals to the nerd in me. If you&rsquo;re looking for &ldquo;the short
version,&rdquo; you won&rsquo;t find it here, because I find the math, physics, and theory
of tuning to be fascinating, and I want to share that and not just the quick
how-to.</p>
