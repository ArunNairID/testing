        <span class="post-date">Sun, Feb 26, 2006</span>
        If you have to prioritize projects (and you do), you are sacrificing one thing for another. What happens when that starts to work against itself? What happens when you can&rsquo;t just put the highest priority project on top? Can you imagine your priorities looking like this?
I see this happen all the time. That&rsquo;s not to say priorities are evil in and of themselves. I&rsquo;m just pointing out that at some point priorities will conflict.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Feb 21, 2006</span>
        MySQL provides several variations on INSERT and UPDATE to allow inserting and updating exactly the desired data. These features provide a lot of power and flexibility, making MySQL significantly more capable than it otherwise might be. In this article I&rsquo;ll give an overview of each feature, help you understand how to choose among them, and point out some things to watch out for.
Setup I am using MySQL 4.1.15 to create my examples.

        Have you noticed how consistent the terminology, tone and style are on the IE blog? Clearly, a lot of work is going into making this blog as good as possible at promoting the work the IE team is doing on the new browser. It remains to be seen how the browser itself evolves, but I think there is a lot to learn from studying the IE blog.
First, it looks to me as though Microsoft have carefully chosen a message, purpose and style for the blog&rsquo;s articles.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Feb 7, 2006</span>
        There are at least two important factors to consider when choosing a column type for a SQL database table: technical requirements and semantics. The choice can be confusing, but it is important to get it right. I&rsquo;ve seen it done both ways and it&rsquo;s sometimes hard to tell what&rsquo;s wrong &ndash; it just feels wrong. In this article I will explain how to spot these mistakes, and more importantly, how to explain the mistake clearly to others.

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Jan 28, 2006</span>
        I&rsquo;ve started getting a lot of spam comments, so I decided the time has come to put a simple system in place to foil the spam robots. In an earlier article I asserted CAPTCHAs are terrible and there are easy ways to foil naive robots without making the site inaccessible or unusable. I&rsquo;ve implemented a simple question-and-answer system to prove my point. Comment forms show a randomly chosen predefined question (I&rsquo;ve only put three in the system) and display several predefined answers, only one of which is correct.

        My main computer is a medieval laptop running Ubuntu GNU/Linux. I used to run Gentoo but tried Ubuntu on a lark, and haven&rsquo;t been motivated enough to change back to Gentoo (or even decide whether I want to, since Ubuntu works fine too). There is one problem, though: Firefox is running more slowly with each release. What to do?
The background I&rsquo;ve been running Firefox since way back when the project got started.

        I have created a web page that matches regular expressions against arbitrary input text and displays the results graphically, so you can take some sample text and build regular expressions the easy way, with immediate feedback about what matches and where, where you have errors, and more.
I&rsquo;ve been working on this for a couple of weeks, a minute here and there as I get time. A few days ago I saw someone created a very nifty similar app over at Rex V.

        IE6, Firefox 1.5 and Opera 8.5 handle regular expressions slightly differently. I analyzed them and learned some interesting things about the browsers. For this article, I&rsquo;m using abcde as the input, and /abc|d(e)/g as the regular expression. The expression should match twice, and the second match should capture the letter &ldquo;e&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s in a capturing subexpression.
Properties of match results Calling RegExp.prototype.exec() with a global regular expression returns an Array object with some extra properties.

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Jan 10, 2006</span>
        XHTML tables provide several elements to group and structure data, including row groups (thead, tbody, and tfoot). Styling row groups with CSS can make data relationships visually obvious. One familiar way to group data visually is with Explorer-style folder icons.
The basic idea is to use tbody as many times as needed to group each set of rows together. The image above shows a single tbody element. I think using multiple tbody elements may not occur to developers because it sounds like there ought to be only one &ndash; but that&rsquo;s not true.

        ASP.NET has built-in functionality to store profile information about a user. The DB table schema has several design trade-offs that make it somewhat inflexible for certain uses.
ASP.NET will write a custom class, given the properties you want, such as name and birthdate. It will also take care of hooking the plumbing up in the database (there is a little script to create the profile tables in the database). It then stores and retrieves the data on subsequent requests.

        A company for whom I have done some coding advertises their years of service on their website. Every year after the New Year, someone notices the dates are out of whack, sends around an email and it has to be fixed. It&rsquo;s not quite hard-coded, if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re thinking. It&rsquo;s just that the wrong thing is hard-coded in the website&rsquo;s configuration file, Config.asp:
Const YearsOfService = 31 I&rsquo;ve seen someone update that variable literally every year I&rsquo;ve been involved with the company in question.

        My credit card says it expires &ldquo;06/07&#8243;. What is that? Is it June 2007, or July 2006? You may think I&rsquo;m being silly, but it confuses me. I&rsquo;m not as smart as some people, but if it confuses me, it&rsquo;s gonna confuse some others too.
I recently placed an order online and got the expiration date wrong. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been all that bad if the entry form had mimicked exactly what&rsquo;s on the front of my card, but the online form had a 4-digit year pulldown, followed by a two-digit space for the month &ndash; exactly the opposite order from my card.

        This article continues my series on parsing and formatting data with JavaScript, this time with numeric data. I don&rsquo;t need to do number parsing, but formatting is very useful. The technique is similar to my date formatting code &ndash; code that writes code (for raw speed), using custom format specifier strings (for flexibility and ease of use). The result is number formatting functionality that is highly efficient, flexible, and easy to use.

        I don&rsquo;t know how spreadsheets do it internally, but at least from a user&rsquo;s perspective, they derive the default cell format from the type of data in the cell. For example, if I enter a number into a cell, the spreadsheet will right-align it. It will format dates and times according to cultural conventions, and will recognize other data types as well. This is the right way to do it, because the formatting conveys information about the data.

        I was playing with custom format strings in Excel recently and noticed something odd. The number of digits to the left of the decimal place seemed to vary bizarrely when using custom format strings for exponential notation, in ways that contradict the documentation. OpenOffice.org doesn&rsquo;t exhibit the same wackiness. Which spreadsheet formats numbers more sanely?
If you&rsquo;re not familiar with custom format strings, it&rsquo;s just a way of making your own format.

        Just a quick note: I found recently that some browsers don&rsquo;t complain when I use future reserved words as identifiers in JavaScript. Specifically, I used char as a variable name, and no Windows browser had a problem with it &ndash; but when I tested on Mac, both Safari and Firefox complained. Apparently there are differences in JavaScript implementation between the Windows and Mac versions of Firefox 1.5!
Nitty-gritty details: the ECMA-262 spec defines reserved words and future reserved words in section 7.

        It&rsquo;s safe to use @@ROWCOUNT in SQL Server 2000 even when there is a trigger on the base table. The trigger will not skew your results; you&rsquo;ll get what you expect. @@ROWCOUNT works correctly even when NOCOUNT is set.
To quote the documentation:
 @@ROWCOUNT
Returns the number of rows affected by the last statement.
 Couldn&rsquo;t be much simpler. Getting the last IDENTITY value is not as straightforward though. There are several options: @@IDENTITY, SCOPE_IDENTITY(), and IDENT_CURRENT().
