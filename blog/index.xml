          <description>&lt;p&gt;The way I think about product/market fit has changed a lot over the years. I
view it differently than I used to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/12/whiskey-stones.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Whiskey Stones&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to think of product/market fit along the lines of: users are enthusiastic, word of mouth is positive, people are delighted, the app is a joy to use, it makes hard things easy, it nails the use case&amp;mdash;the app solves a problem or meets a need in such a way that it makes users happy. I&amp;rsquo;ve built the right thing to do the right thing in the right way. Obviously product/market fit, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. That&amp;rsquo;s service/user fit, not product/market fit. It&amp;rsquo;s not a bad thing, but it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; different. It took me a while to see that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s dig into what those three words (product, market, fit) mean. The following discussion is especially informed by my experience in business-to-business, but the general concepts are just as true in B2C or other types of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;product&#34;&gt;Product&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is a product? A lot of people, especially engineers, especially past-me, think the product is the thing they build. I used to think of the product as the app, the service, the UI, the UX, the functionality. This couldn&amp;rsquo;t be further from the truth. The product isn&amp;rsquo;t what you &lt;em&gt;build&lt;/em&gt;. The product is what you &lt;em&gt;sell&lt;/em&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to confuse one for the other, but important to understand the difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take whiskey stones as an example. Look at listings on Amazon and you&amp;rsquo;ll see sellers promoting the benefits of whiskey stones: chills your bourbon without diluting it with meltwater, no mess, reusable, convenient, etc. Sounds legit, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what&amp;rsquo;s the product, really? Is it the stones? No. To quote the famous line, people don&amp;rsquo;t buy quarter-inch drill bits, they buy quarter-inch holes. The product is the &lt;em&gt;result or outcome&lt;/em&gt;. Ostensibly chilled-but-not-ruined whiskey, but we&amp;rsquo;ll revisit that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I use a dating app as an example, the product isn&amp;rsquo;t the app, it&amp;rsquo;s companionship. If I use VividCortex, the product isn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vividcortex.com/&#34;&gt;database monitoring&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s improved revenue through a more responsive and efficient app or service. If the example is group chat, the product isn&amp;rsquo;t chat rooms, it&amp;rsquo;s a more connected and efficient workforce with less need for meetings. (Arguably.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;market&#34;&gt;Market&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I used to think of market very differently. I used to think the market was the user, but now I recognize that users don&amp;rsquo;t have to be the buyers. In Geoffrey Moore&amp;rsquo;s classic &lt;em&gt;Crossing the Chasm&lt;/em&gt;, he defines a market as &amp;ldquo;a set of actual or potential &lt;em&gt;customers&lt;/em&gt;, for a given set of products or services, who have a common set of needs or wants, and who reference each other when making a buying decision.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no fluff words in that definition. Importantly, the market is who you sell to. The market is the &lt;em&gt;buyer&lt;/em&gt;, not the user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who is Facebook&amp;rsquo;s market? It isn&amp;rsquo;t the billions of users on their service. It&amp;rsquo;s the advertisers! If you&amp;rsquo;re selling a dating app, your users and buyers are the same. If you&amp;rsquo;re creating a free dating app that&amp;rsquo;s ad-supported, your users and market are not the same. When they&amp;rsquo;re the same, it&amp;rsquo;s just a coincidence. Many or perhaps even most products are sold to someone other than the users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At VividCortex, for example, our users are developers, DBAs, technical operations teams, SREs, and the like. And, sure, these are our champions for promoting a sale internally, too. But we don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;sell&lt;/em&gt; to them, we sell to VPs and the C-suite and so on. In fact, we sell to &lt;em&gt;organizations&lt;/em&gt;, not individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A clear understanding of the market helps inform a clear understanding of the product. When you think about who &lt;em&gt;buys&lt;/em&gt; whiskey stones, the difference becomes obvious. If you talk to a whiskey drinker, or just read the reviews on Amazon, you hear something different than the product listing would like you to believe. &amp;ldquo;One star. My brother-in-law gave this to me. I know he meant well, but don&amp;rsquo;t give these as a gift. They&amp;rsquo;re just a hazard. They&amp;rsquo;ll smash your lips, break your teeth, and you&amp;rsquo;ll end up paying thousands of dollars for dental repairs. And they don&amp;rsquo;t chill well.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who buys whiskey stones? Not whiskey drinkers. The actual market is their brothers-in-law. And that helps clarify what the product really is. The real product here, what the whiskey stone makers are selling, is a warm fuzzy feeling for people who think their brother-in-law is hard to buy for. The product listing, with its supposed benefits, is not designed to appeal to the drinkers, but to their relatives. And it literally plays to their ignorance about whiskey drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;fit&#34;&gt;Fit&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You have product/market fit when you have clearly identified the &lt;em&gt;product&lt;/em&gt;, as just explained, and it &lt;em&gt;fits&lt;/em&gt; your &lt;em&gt;market&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; needs. Whiskey stone sellers have done a great job of selling warm fuzzies to in-laws; they have very good product/market fit. (What happens after the sale is a different matter.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A really important part of fit &lt;em&gt;includes how your market buys&lt;/em&gt;. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t aligned your delivery mechanism with your market&amp;rsquo;s purchasing mechanisms, you don&amp;rsquo;t have product/market fit. For example, if you sell to the government, you probably have to go through approved channels and meet various types of regulatory approval. Otherwise nobody in the government can actually buy what you&amp;rsquo;re selling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put this in terms of VividCortex again: we initially built a database monitoring service that made DBAs happy. Great! Nice service/user fit. Then we had to figure out how to sell it. Creating actual product/market fit required creating a sales team, enunciating our security stance, aligning our processes with the finance departments of our customers, and so on. This was &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; more than just the app or service; that&amp;rsquo;s a small fraction of the whole product&amp;mdash;the tip of the proverbial iceberg. This is why I said &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/four-core-ip/&#34;&gt;sales is a key part of a company&amp;rsquo;s core IP&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, we&amp;rsquo;re selling the whole package&amp;mdash;our entire company&amp;mdash;to each buyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember the first time we &amp;ldquo;closed&amp;rdquo; a deal with a big company. We had all the approvals, legal signoff, even a signature on the order form! The money was as good as in-the-bank. The next step was to talk to someone in the procurement department. No big deal, it sounded like we were just talking to finance in the usual way, figuring out who could issue the purchase order and giving them the bank wiring details. NO. This time it was different. They renegotiated the entire deal from scratch, put the hammer down on pricing, and killed the deal, refusing to let the company buy what dozens of people had worked hard to bring into their team for months. What the actual!?!?!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was our first customer with a procurement department. As I was about to learn, big companies use these because there&amp;rsquo;s no chance all of their thousands of employees are going to negotiate good deals when they&amp;rsquo;re across the table from a salesperson with decades of experience. So companies put in gatekeepers &lt;em&gt;and give them commissions based on how much they&amp;rsquo;re able to browbeat vendors&lt;/em&gt;. These people can be absolute bulldogs (but usually in a very nice, apparently helpful but my-hands-are-tied way). The definition of their job is to get the vendor on their knees begging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s the end of the quarter and you&amp;rsquo;ve been using our service on hundreds of servers for 6 months already! Pleeeeease!!!&amp;rdquo;  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going on vacation, be back in a couple of weeks.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Who&amp;rsquo;ll handle our case in your absence?&amp;rdquo;  &lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;OUT OF OFFICE: RE: VividCortex Contract&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your worst nightmare. But you know what? &lt;em&gt;This is part of product/market fit.&lt;/em&gt; If you haven&amp;rsquo;t built your company to sell through your customers&amp;rsquo; purchasing processes, you don&amp;rsquo;t have product/market fit. Your market is your buyers, and procurement is ultimately the buyer in this example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revisiting Moore&amp;rsquo;s definition, it&amp;rsquo;s also helpful to remember that your market isn&amp;rsquo;t individual buyers. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a &lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt; of buyers, plural, with commonalities. This points out that one-off deals don&amp;rsquo;t constitute &amp;ldquo;fit.&amp;rdquo; Fit is achieved when your product, taken as a whole (i.e. not only what you sell, but how you deliver it to your market) fits your market as a whole. You&amp;rsquo;re not trying to create one-by-one fit, you&amp;rsquo;re trying to create something scalable and repeatable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Product/market fit is very different from what I thought when I founded VividCortex. I was really thinking about service/user fit without knowing it. Product/market fit isn&amp;rsquo;t when your users are getting value from your app. It&amp;rsquo;s when you sell the value you create, and your market&amp;mdash;a set of customers with common needs and who have herd buying behavior&amp;mdash;purchases and acquires it effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three words (product, market, fit) require clear understanding to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://forestry.io&#34;&gt;Forestry&lt;/a&gt; is a content management system that runs in your browser. On the backend, it integrates with a static site generator such as Hugo, letting you edit your static website in your browser just like any other content management system. I am writing this blog post with it on my iPad, using voice dictation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/11/forest.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;forest&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setup was very easy, and although I had a slight hiccup importing my existing site, which is large, their support team was responsive and got that taken care of quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Editing appears to be very straightforward so far, and I do not see any problems that seem to be showstoppers. I am seeing some unwanted newlines and capitalization behavior in the markdown editor, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t bother me too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uploading an image may prove to be slightly challenging. It feels 99% functional, but the last 1% is confusing. I am not sure where the image I uploaded has gone, and when I publish this I am not sure if it will be broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that the location where the source code for my site is hosted has not changed. All I did was authorize Forestry to access and change that source code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will not exercise the full set of capabilities of this product. I host my site using an amazing static site hosting service called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.netlify.com&#34;&gt;Netlify&lt;/a&gt;. They take care of watching for changes in the repository, fetching the changes, building the site from that source, and publishing that on their content delivery network. If I were not using this service, I think &lt;a href=&#34;https://forestry.io&#34;&gt;Forestry&lt;/a&gt; could cover some of those needs.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Response Time Stretch Factor</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/response-time-stretch-factor/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2016 10:00:39 -0400</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/response-time-stretch-factor/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Computer systems, and for that matter all types of systems that receive requests
and process them, have a response time that includes some time waiting in queue
if the server is busy when a request arrives. The wait time increases sharply as
the server gets busier. For simple M/M/m systems there is a simple equation that
describes this exactly, but for more complicated systems this equation is only
approximate. This has rattled around in my brain for a long time, and rather
than keeping my notes private I&amp;rsquo;m sharing them here (although since I&amp;rsquo;m still
trying to learn this stuff I may just be putting my ignorance on full display).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/10/hockey-stick.png&#34; alt=&#34;Hockey-Stick Curve&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll skip all the derivations and go through only the basics to get to the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-stretch-factor-heuristic-and-exact-formula&#34;&gt;The Stretch Factor Heuristic and Exact Formula&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The equation describing the curve above is derived as follows. When a request
arrives at the server, it will have to wait time \(S\), the service time, to be
completed. But if the server is busy, which happens with some probability, then
it will be delayed some additional wait time \(W\) for the request in process,
and potentially for other requests are already waiting, before it enters
service. The total time is the residence time, \(R = W + S\).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wait time \(W\) is some fraction of the total residence time, which can be
at most 100%, and if this is denoted by \(\rho\) then \(W = \rho R\).
Thus,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
R = W + S = \rho R + S
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which, when rearranged and divided by service time to make it a relative
&amp;ldquo;stretch factor,&amp;rdquo; becomes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
R = \frac{1}{1- \rho}
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of this is original; I&amp;rsquo;ve basically cribbed this from Neil Gunther&amp;rsquo;s book
&lt;em&gt;Analyzing Computer Systems Performance with Perl::PDQ&lt;/em&gt;. Later in that same
book, Gunther shows the derivation of a related formula for the stretch factor
in a multiserver queue with \(m\) servers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
R \approx \frac{1}{1-\rho^m}
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where \(\rho\) denotes server utilization. This heuristic approximation does
arise analytically, but is not exact when there are more than 2 servers. It
underestimates wait time when utilization is high, especially with large numbers
of servers (say, 64). The exact solution is given by&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
R = \frac{C(m, \rho) S}{m(1-\rho)} + S
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the first term is just \(W\), and the function \(C(m,\rho)\) is the
Erlang C function. If we put it all together and rearrange into &amp;ldquo;stretch factor&amp;rdquo; form, the Erlang equation for stretch factor is&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
R(m, \rho) = 1 + \frac{ \frac{(m \rho)^m}{m!} }{ (1-\rho) \sum_{n=0}^{m-1} \frac{(m \rho)^n}{n!} + \frac{(m \rho)^m}{m!} } \frac{1}{m(1-\rho)}
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to see how this looks, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.desmos.com/calculator/9dr7azq0ot&#34;&gt;this Desmos calculator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here&amp;rsquo;s the part my brain has been trying to connect, almost idly in
shower-thought time, for a while. If intuition led from one direction to the
heuristic approximation \(R=\frac{1}{1-\rho^m}\), and an exact derivation leads to
a formula that in the single- and dual-server case is the same as the
heuristic, then what is the heuristic missing to extend to an exact multiserver
queueing system? Can it be extended, or is it just a coincidence that it&amp;rsquo;s an
exact solution for \(m=1, m=2\)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few trains of thought have sprung into my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I observed that the Erlang C formula includes \(m!\), and it happens to be the
case that 1! = 1, and 2! = 2. A clue, or a distraction? What if I add a term
to the heuristic, multiplied by \(m/m!\) or similar, which would just reduce
to the same thing for the single- and dual-server cases? What form would that
term take?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, what if I work backwards from the Erlang formula and see if it reduces
to a different form of the heuristic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, what if the heuristic&amp;rsquo;s exactness for the base cases is just a
coincidence after all? In that case, perhaps a new, simpler approximation to the
Erlang formula is waiting to be invented. Approximations are highly useful to me
in tools such as spreadsheets and the like, or even in using intuition, which is
workable with the heuristic form. Approximations are easy to think about and a
lot easier to type and troubleshoot. They&amp;rsquo;re also faster to compute, should
performance matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll take each of these cases in turn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-missing-term&#34;&gt;A Missing Term&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the heuristic is exact for 1- and 2-server cases because of the coincidence
that the factorial function for these values is the value itself, then what is
the missing term? What shape might it have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To gain some intuition about this, I wrote a simple &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qo1n4shf1f&#34;&gt;Desmos
calculator&lt;/a&gt; to show
the &lt;em&gt;value&lt;/em&gt; of the hypothetical &amp;ldquo;missing term&amp;rdquo; in the context of the heuristic&amp;rsquo;s
value. In other words, the heuristic&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;error function&lt;/em&gt;.  Here&amp;rsquo;s a picture of
that for several values of \(m\). Red is 1 server, green is 8, purple is 16, orange
is 64.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/10/error-in-heuristic.png&#34; alt=&#34;Error in Heuristic&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that I showed utilization extending out beyond the value 1 because the
shape of the function is interesting, but that value is impossible&amp;mdash;a server can
never be more than 100% utilized. What&amp;rsquo;s interesting, to me anyway, is that the
error function looks kind of like the PDF of a Gamma distribution. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that thought
there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what form a term including, say, \(m/m!\) would take. This is
something I haven&amp;rsquo;t explored a lot yet. &lt;em&gt;TODO&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reducing-erlang&#34;&gt;Reducing Erlang&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;!-- Wolfram Alpha input

1 + ((m p)^m/m!)/((1-p) Sum[(m p)^n/n!, {n, 0, m-1}] + (m p)^m/m!) * 1/(m(1-p)), m=1

--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does the Erlang formula reduce to in the \(m=1\) case? The Erlang C
formula itself reduces to \(\rho\), and when
decorated with the additional stuff to get it into stretch-factor form, it
reduces to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
R(1, \rho) = 1 + \frac{\rho}{1-\rho}
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is just a rearrangement of the heuristic function.
(Interestingly, Wolfram Alpha will simplify it to
include the Gamma function and list the heuristic as an approximation. Gamma
again, though Gamma function and Gamma distribution are different. The Gamma
function is closely related to the factorial function.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the \(m=2\) case, if I&amp;rsquo;m doing my algebra right, the Erlang C function
simplifies to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
C(2, \rho) = \frac{2\rho^2}{ (1-\rho) + (1-\rho)2\rho + 2\rho^2}
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which further simplifies to \(\frac{2\rho^2}{\rho+1}\), which when
rewritten into stretch-factor form, becomes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
R(2, \rho)=1+\frac{2\rho^2}{\rho+1} \frac{1}{2(1-\rho)}
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is exactly \(\frac{1}{1-\rho^2}\), the heuristic form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At \(m=3\) and above, the heuristic is only approximate. What does the Erlang
form reduce to for the first of those cases? Does it result in the missing term
that will extend to 4 and beyond too? (&lt;em&gt;Note: I wrote about this in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/erlang-stretch-factor-three-four/&#34;&gt;followup
post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;approximations-to-erlang-based-on-the-heuristic&#34;&gt;Approximations to Erlang, Based on the Heuristic&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Approximations to complicated equations are often really useful. You use them
all the time, although you may not know it. For example, a computer uses
approximations to calculate functions such as sine, square root, and logarithm.
The field of numeric methods is dedicated to studying such algorithms and their
errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1977, Sakasegawa discovered an approximation to the length of a queue, which
is more accurate than the heuristic function, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t derived analytically.
You can find the paper
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/VividCortex/approx-queueing-theory&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. In a nutshell,
his method was to begin with a well-known queueing theory formula derived by
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollaczek%E2%80%93Khinchine_formula&#34;&gt;Pollaczek and
Khinchine&lt;/a&gt;,
which is valid (exact) for M/G/1 systems, that is, single-server queueing
systems in some specific cases. Sakasegawa observed the error curve at various
parameters and essentially did a least-squares sum of errors regression to
arrive at an approximation for the queue length, which in the simplest types of
queueing systems reduces to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
L_q \approx \frac{ \rho^{\sqrt{2(m+1)}} }{ 1-\rho}
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &amp;ldquo;stretch factor&amp;rdquo; form, this becomes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
R(m, \rho) \approx 1+\frac{\rho^{\sqrt{2(m+1)}}}{\rho m(1-\rho)}
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is such an accurate approximation that it&amp;rsquo;s more than good enough for
real-life applications, and I use it all the time. (It&amp;rsquo;s hard to put Erlang&amp;rsquo;s
formula into a spreadsheet, because it has iterative computations.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the usefulness and simplicity of approximations, perhaps an approximation
to the stretch factor can be derived from the heuristic form
\(1/(1-\rho^m)\). This idea appeals to me because it might lead to insights
about what&amp;rsquo;s disappeared or simplified out of the exact Erlang formula in the
base case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One possible way to do this is to approximate the error function of the
heuristic.  I already mentioned that it might be possible to do this with the
Gamma distribution&amp;rsquo;s PDF. Finding an approximation to that, and then adding or
multiplying by it, might result in a usable approximation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another idea is a sigmoid such as the classic logistic function. In fact, if I
wanted to approximate the error in the range (0,1) this isn&amp;rsquo;t too bad an
approximation for \(m=16\), for example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
\frac{.5}{1+e^{-10(x-1)}}
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, instead of adding a term or multiplying the heuristic by a term,
perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s the \(\rho^m\) portion in the denominator that needs to be
tweaked. A little analysis led me to the following conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The error at \(m&amp;gt;3\) could be explained by the exponent \(m\) being too large. If so,
then the correct value for the exponent could be a function of \(\rho\), and
an adjustment to it would need to be of the form&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
A_{exp} = \frac{log\left( \frac{E(\rho)-1}{E(\rho)} \right)}{log(\rho)}
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where \(E(\rho)\) is the Erlang formula for the stretch factor. I arrived at
this by solving the error function for \(\rho\). For convenience, this can be
divided by \(m\) to normalize it relative to the number of servers. I&amp;rsquo;ve made
a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.desmos.com/calculator/7ygut81via&#34;&gt;Desmos calculator&lt;/a&gt; illustrating
the shape of this adjustment term for 1, 4, 8, and 16 servers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/10/heuristic-error-func-util.png&#34; alt=&#34;Error in Heuristic as Func of Util&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the challenges with this is that due to the limitations of floating-point
math in computers, the heuristic function appears to have no error at low
utilization. I think it does, but it&amp;rsquo;s just a small value. That&amp;rsquo;s why the shape
of that curve has a discontinuity at low utilization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting observation: If you zoom out and remove the limits on the range
of values plotted, you get something that looks like a part of the Gamma
function. Is this a coincidence? Could the Gamma function be used as an
approximation to this error? Or is the missing term a Gamma function, which
would result in an exact solution? &lt;em&gt;TODO&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to nudge the heuristic to approximate the Erlang residence time
stretch factor would be to examine whether the base, \(\rho\), is too large
or too small. Following a similar train of thought as before and solving the
error function for the number of servers, I found that the error would need to be of the
form&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
A_{base} = \left( \frac{E(\rho)-1}{E(\rho)}\right)^{1/m}
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normalizing this relative to \(\rho\) by dividing, I got a function that has
similar discontinuities as before, and is of the following shape. It looks
like it might be possible to approximate with something like a quadratic from 0
to 1, but if you zoom out further, it looks more like&amp;hellip; wait for it&amp;hellip; part of
the Gamma function. You can see this on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.desmos.com/calculator/hsidkl4og8&#34;&gt;Desmos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/10/heuristic-error-func-servers.png&#34; alt=&#34;Heuristic Error as Func of Servers&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experimented with this in a different way, by trying to approximate
\(A_{base}\) directly. I just guessed at its shape and came up with the
following, which isn&amp;rsquo;t too far off for \(2&amp;lt;m&amp;lt;5\):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
A_{base} \approx \rho - \frac{2}{15} \sqrt{m} (\rho-1)\rho
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see this shape, compared with the actual \(A_{base}\), at this
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.desmos.com/calculator/sgwrqdcnzk&#34;&gt;Desmos&lt;/a&gt;. And &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.desmos.com/calculator/opa1sfpxfw&#34;&gt;this
one&lt;/a&gt; shows what this looks like
when included as a term in the heuristic stretch factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/10/heuristic-skew-util.png&#34; alt=&#34;Heuristic Skewed By Utilization&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red is Erlang, blue is my heuristic, and black dashed is Gunther&amp;rsquo;s.
Don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled; mine may look better, but if you examine high utilizations
you&amp;rsquo;ll see it&amp;rsquo;s much worse. Small errors in the approximation to the error
function make big differences in the result. (This is true if the error is
defined as a function of number of servers, too.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of outright superstition in this blog post, but hopefully some of
the intuition I&amp;rsquo;m trying to develop comes through as well. Guessing at
approximations (and seeing Gamma-things everywhere, like shapes in the clouds)
is probably more time-wasting than productive, but I find that by playing with
things I learn a lot. There&amp;rsquo;s something still unfinished in my mind, something
unsatisfactory about coming towards an exact solution from two directions,
finding two different forms, and finding that one of them runs aground at a
certain point, even though it&amp;rsquo;s just a simplification of the other under some
circumstances. You might replace &amp;ldquo;even though&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;because&amp;rdquo; in the previous
sentence, and be satisfied, but as for me I feel there&amp;rsquo;s still something to be
learned here. And potentially a useful result might come out of it, even if
it&amp;rsquo;s only a fast approximation like Sakasegawa&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides, I just enjoy exploring math and its shapes; this is a great form of
relaxation or stress relief for me when I want to concentrate on something so as
to put other things out of my mind. Hopefully there&amp;rsquo;s a kindred soul out there
who finds this interesting too. If so, hello, and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>Why I&#39;m Not Waiting To Prioritize Diversity</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2016/04/18/why-prioritize-diversity-now/</link>
          <pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2016 10:09:11 -0500</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2016/04/18/why-prioritize-diversity-now/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a vacant board seat at VividCortex, and I&amp;rsquo;m making diversity one of my priorities as I begin to search. I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed this with a range of people over the last several months. Nearly everyone has asked me to clarify what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to achieve, and why. Some have challenged me to defend why I believe diversity is a must-have at this stage of VividCortex&amp;rsquo;s growth. In the end, it&amp;rsquo;s my job to make the call. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that diversity is a priority (not the sole priority, but a priority) now, not later. Here&amp;rsquo;s why&amp;mdash;and here&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;m following through on that decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/04/board.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Board&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;purpose-and-audience&#34;&gt;Purpose and Audience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote this blog post with a variety of people in mind: my current and future board members and investors, my current and future employees, customers, peers in similar positions, and the unanticipatable readers who might be influenced by reading what I write. I&amp;rsquo;m also thinking about the people who might be motivated and able to help me after reading this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to think that I&amp;rsquo;m not just another white man who feels enlightened and wants people to know that he cares about diversity. This isn&amp;rsquo;t written from a place of guilt or difficult-to-verbalize strong feelings. I&amp;rsquo;ve thought a lot about this, gone through several drafts over a period of months, and sought reviews and feedback from many people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing this is a way for me to clarify, for myself and others, the position I&amp;rsquo;ve adopted and how I&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at it. My goal is not to express a sense of completion and finality, but to continue the process of learning, listening, and seeking and considering advice. To the extent that sharing this publicly is valuable to others, that&amp;rsquo;s good too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-benefits-of-diversity&#34;&gt;The Benefits of Diversity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A huge number of studies across many years show that diverse groups of people outperform in a variety of ways. In a nutshell, diverse groups of people make better decisions, solve complex problems better, consider more solutions to challenges, have access to more resources, execute more quickly, are more ethical, have fewer problems and make fewer mistakes, are more cost efficient, grow more quickly, and generate higher revenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is true across a variety of industries, and it&amp;rsquo;s especially true when there&amp;rsquo;s diversity in leadership positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An aside: in technology, diversity is often a synonym for &lt;em&gt;gender&lt;/em&gt; diversity, specifically, &lt;em&gt;women in tech&lt;/em&gt;. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be; we should consider age, race, geography of origin, socioeconomic class, sexual identity, native language, and much more. But in 2016, women-in-tech is often the primary type of diversity that people think about in tech. It also seems to have been the subject of more formal studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do those studies find? Here are a few examples, focused mostly on women in tech:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Companies with at least one female board member had a return on equity of 14.1 percent over the past nine years, greater than the 11.2 percent for those without any women. The stock valuations are also higher for gender diverse boards versus all-male ones.&amp;rdquo; Source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2014/09/25/3572355/women-on-boards-performance/&#34;&gt;Credit Suisse&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;The findings were startlingly consistent: for companies ranking in the top quartile of executive-board diversity, ROEs were 53 percent higher, on average, than they were for those in the bottom quartile. At the same time, EBIT margins at the most diverse companies were 14 percent higher, on average, than those of the least diverse companies. The results were similar across all but one of the countries we studied; an exception was ROE performance in France; but even there, EBIT was 50 percent higher for diverse companies.&amp;rdquo; Source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/is-there-a-payoff-from-top-team-diversity&#34;&gt;McKinsey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Organizations that are the most inclusive of women in top management achieve 35% higher ROE and 34% better total return to shareholders versus their peers&amp;mdash;and research shows gender diversity to be particularly valuable where innovation is key.&amp;rdquo; Source: &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.illuminate.com/whitepaper/&#34;&gt;Illuminate Ventures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.kit.edu/kit/english/pi_2011_8294.php&#34;&gt;http://www.kit.edu/kit/english/pi_2011_8294.php&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079147&#34;&gt;http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079147&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implications could not be more clear. Diversity is a huge lever for success. And we&amp;rsquo;ve known this for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anecdotally, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the results in real life. I recently signed a contract with &lt;a href=&#34;https://lever.co&#34;&gt;Lever&lt;/a&gt;, a recruiting software company. As I did a competitive bake-off with alternatives, I paid a lot of attention to who interacted with me. My sales rep from Lever was a woman. My onboarding was with a woman. My customer success manager is a woman. All of them have been professional and competent. The product and service is phenomenal. The design, the documentation, how well trained everyone is, the promptness of help and bug fixes, the thoughtfulness of so many little things&amp;mdash;they are nailing it. In comparison, another company assigned me a white male sales rep who, despite past jobs as a recruiter, lacked training or experience, couldn&amp;rsquo;t help me, and was often wrong and never in doubt. These companies have big differences in diversity in their staff: Lever has a woman CEO/founder and quite a few women in leadership positions; the other company has visibly less diversity at the leadership level and apparently advances the careers of underperforming white men, judging by my experience. Draw your own conclusions, but I&amp;rsquo;ve seen enough examples that I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s coincidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-importance-of-board-diversity&#34;&gt;The Importance of Board Diversity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding someone to your board is a major decision. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t been a CEO, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick summary. The board of directors is one of the most important teams in the company, because they provide accountability and leadership for the CEO and other company executives. The board members need to be chosen carefully for what they can contribute to the company&amp;rsquo;s success. As seen in the studies I cited above, they can contribute a lot; board members have huge influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And a board member isn&amp;rsquo;t like most employees who can be terminated at will. When you appoint a board member, you should regard it as semi-permanent. It can be difficult or impossible to change a board member.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly it&amp;rsquo;s important to find the best possible board members for your company, but why is it important to build board diversity? Many of the studies I mentioned or linked above deal with diversity on the board. How exactly do diverse &lt;em&gt;boards&lt;/em&gt;, as opposed to overall diversity in the team, produce better results?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of debate about this. I believe one of the most important things diverse boards do is set the precedent for diversity in the whole company. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious to me that boards are enormously influential in hiring, especially in the top leadership positions. Diverse boards build diverse leadership teams. And that creates diversity in middle management and individual contributor positions. Diversity, in other words, flows from the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, as an expert on the topic wrote me, &amp;ldquo;Structure is more powerful than the individual&amp;mdash;and also easier for leaders to control.  For this reason, &lt;a href=&#34;http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01400/full&#34;&gt;studies of sexism in the workplace typically recommend&lt;/a&gt; addressing &amp;lsquo;organizational structures, processes, and practices rather than focusing solely on reducing sexism in individual employees.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo; Corporate boards wield tremendous power over those factors, helping to reduce sexism, one of the major factors that influences women to leave careers in technology in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recruiting great people is a huge competitive advantage for companies, which is one of the most important effects of diversity at the executive and board level. Companies with diverse leadership have access to a larger pool of candidates, it&amp;rsquo;s easier (and thus cheaper) to attract them, and retention is better. Recruiting and turnover are huge costs, so all of these factors go directly to the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do companies with diverse boards and executive teams enjoy these benefits? The easiest way to understand is to look at what happens when the company&amp;rsquo;s About Us or Team page is several rows of mostly white males. People of diverse backgrounds are much less likely to join those companies. I intentionally follow conversations about this online, and since I began doing so, I&amp;rsquo;ve been impressed over and over again by the strength of people&amp;rsquo;s convictions. I&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed lots of cases where people I admire have declined to join teams that lack diversity. They don&amp;rsquo;t see themselves or their values reflected in the team portraits, and they feel strongly enough about it that they take a stand publicly to make a point of it. (It&amp;rsquo;s working: I noticed.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outcome is that companies with non-diverse boards have much less access to qualified candidates. They&amp;rsquo;re recruiting from a much smaller pool, which itself is more likely to be non-diverse, with all of the consequences that entails for performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A diverse board can also make a difference in forming relationships with other companies, too. My own story about selecting a recruiting software vendor is only one of several examples I could cite. And many of the people I know bring their values into vendor decisions too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i&amp;rsquo;m so interested in containers, but is there literally any container co out
there that doesn&amp;rsquo;t support harassing and/or assaulting women?
- &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mipsytipsy/status/723564461265580034&#34;&gt;@mipsytipsy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be remiss if I didn&amp;rsquo;t take this opportunity to point out that lack of diversity is a negative spiral that limits access to opportunities for many people, and that&amp;rsquo;s unjust. As with company performance, the outcomes are unambiguous: lack of diversity gives rise to many types of discrimination. One that&amp;rsquo;s relevant in the context of an article about a board search is women&amp;rsquo;s greatly limited ability to raise venture capital funding as compared to men. Women who aren&amp;rsquo;t recruited into leadership positions don&amp;rsquo;t easily become part of the clique that leads to upward mobility into funding, founding, board positions, and so on. These are not accidental, blameless, or victimless outcomes. Diversity is not just a smart business decision, it is a matter of ethics and morals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that all of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned in this section&amp;mdash;diverse staff, better performance, increased willingness to buy/partner, more inclusiveness leading to better rising-tide-all-boats opportunities&amp;mdash;are at least partially outcomes of board diversity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-diversity-matters-earlier-than-i-thought&#34;&gt;Why Diversity Matters Earlier Than I Thought&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VividCortex is growing strongly and is in great shape financially, but it would be a mistake to think we can afford to relax even slightly. We are a startup, and we can still falter or fail. We must focus all of our efforts on getting things done. That&amp;rsquo;s why I wasn&amp;rsquo;t surprised when some of my advisors asked me if this is really the right time to prioritize diversity in the board. We have a lot of important things to do!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some things must be done early, though. One example is establishing the company&amp;rsquo;s mission, vision, and values. Without such tools to provide clear direction, a company struggles to execute effectively. As founder, I focused on these things from day one, building on the basis of my personal mission, vision, and values. The first three values I identified for VividCortex are &amp;ldquo;The Golden Rule,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Mutual Improvement,&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Work Lean.&amp;rdquo; These values are beliefs about right and wrong that serve as guidelines for making decisions, and they&amp;rsquo;re called &lt;em&gt;core&lt;/em&gt; because they are non-negotiable, mandatory values the organization must exemplify to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These core values are followed by &lt;em&gt;aspirational values&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;diversity, humor, humility, honesty, frugality, focus, fitness, sharing, and listening.&amp;rdquo; This list is values that are important but non-mandatory, or perhaps as the name implies, aspirational: not true today, but something to work towards. I struggled with whether diversity should be a core value, but ultimately decided that although we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do as well with a non-diverse group, it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t flat-out kill us. I listed diversity in first place as a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my mind, though. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to believe that diversity truly is core to achieving excellence. Not only that, I think the definition of excellence itself needs to include diversity. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can say, with a clear conscience, that we&amp;rsquo;ll have achieved excellence if our About Us page grows to look like some of those I&amp;rsquo;ve visited recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not as diverse as I want us to be now. We&amp;rsquo;re a small team, so we&amp;rsquo;re not far down the road and we haven&amp;rsquo;t made an unrecoverable misstep. But at some point it gets much harder. To see where this road leads, consider this post-departure quote from one of Twitter&amp;rsquo;s few black employees:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;With my departure, Twitter no longer has any managers, directors, or VP&amp;rsquo;s of color in engineering or product management. From this position, Twitter may find it difficult to make the changes to culture and product.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/tech-diversity-files/thought-on-diversity-part-2-why-diversity-is-difficult-3dfd552fa1f7&#34;&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mostly-white, mostly-male, or mostly-both is a dead end. There are so many men in tech, and the individual and structural biases are so pervasive, that this is the likely outcome for every company that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make diversity a priority, especially at the leadership level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It reminds me of my days at Boy Scout Camp, learning how to sail. The wind was never blowing the way I wanted to go, but &amp;ldquo;the wind blew me there&amp;rdquo; is not an acceptable reason for ending up in the reeds instead of at the dock. As a sailor, you acknowledge and work with the wind, but you focus on the destination, and you do what it takes to reach it regardless. As a CEO it&amp;rsquo;s the same way; you can&amp;rsquo;t just be passive and hire whoever falls into your lap, you have to be intentional and work to create the outcomes you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Companies whose teams are too homogeneous have a serious chicken-and-egg problem to solve. They&amp;rsquo;re painted into a corner. I don&amp;rsquo;t think you can start thinking about this too soon. If I&amp;rsquo;d understood this earlier, I&amp;rsquo;d have focused on it earlier myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that brings me back to the board search. As I fill this next board seat, it&amp;rsquo;s clear to me that it&amp;rsquo;s a watershed moment. There are three of us on the board now, all males, two of us white. The fourth member will vote with us to elect a fifth someday. If the fourth member is a white male, our chances of finding and recruiting a diverse fifth member are poor. If you were, say, a woman, would you want to be the only woman on a five-member board? If our board becomes five people who are homogenous along a major axis, we probably missed our best chance to create a diverse company. The fourth board member really matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-i-m-searching&#34;&gt;How I&amp;rsquo;m Searching&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said, the winds don&amp;rsquo;t blow towards diversity, so if I&amp;rsquo;m passive in this search I won&amp;rsquo;t get the outcome I need. That means my search for a diverse board member must be deliberately inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m the first to admit that I&amp;rsquo;m not completely sure how to do this. Part of the reason I wrote this post was to ask for your help, because it seems to me that as a community we&amp;rsquo;re not as good at this as we could be. If I want to build an API or a mobile app, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of expertise readily available, but recruiting a diverse board member? Few people I know have actually done that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My first step, of course, was to research. I Googled &amp;ldquo;how to conduct an inclusive job search.&amp;rdquo; The results were beyond disappointing; mostly a scattered collection of rather unrelated websites from academic departments, with a few results from the U.S. Department of Labor and various recruiters thrown in. Related searches such as &amp;ldquo;how to recruit inclusively&amp;rdquo; fared no better. This reinforced my impression that not enough people in the technology industry are thinking about and practicing inclusive hiring, let alone discussing it with (or promoting it to) others. If I&amp;rsquo;d seen results from a major tech company titled &lt;em&gt;How We Recruited A Diverse Team&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;rsquo;d feel a lot better about our industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since there doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be much to learn from tech companies, I looked to other industries. For example, one person mentioned the Rooney Rule to me. It&amp;rsquo;s an NFL (pro football) policy stating that teams have to at least &lt;em&gt;interview&lt;/em&gt; minority candidates for senior roles. Obviously this doesn&amp;rsquo;t ensure the desired outcome, but it&amp;rsquo;s a step in the right direction; if you don&amp;rsquo;t interview any minority candidates you clearly are doing something wrong. The Rooney Rule is used broadly now, not just in the NFL. (Had you ever heard of it? I hadn&amp;rsquo;t.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another suggestion was to hire a diversity-focused recruiter. Alternatively, emphasize the importance of minority candidates to a recruiter, whether diversity-focused or not. I haven&amp;rsquo;t decided whether I&amp;rsquo;m going to use a recruiter for this search. I don&amp;rsquo;t know whether I should; your advice is welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the stages of any recruitment effort, whether traditional or for a specialized role such as a board, are a) defining the role b) publicizing the vacancy c) outreach d) interviewing and e) selection. It&amp;rsquo;s clear to me that diversity and inclusiveness need to be considered at each step. Some of these steps are very important, such as outreach. Relying on networks is proven to result in similar hires, not diversity. It would be easier to just ask for in-network references, but that&amp;rsquo;s sailing where the wind blows. So clearly someone&amp;mdash;me or someone I hire&amp;mdash;is going to have to actively search and reach out to candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a board search seems to be handled very differently from an executive hire, from what I can see. Maybe there are good reasons for it, but no one seems to post job listings or the like. In the absence of experience with this, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit uncertain: in what ways am I ignorant? What don&amp;rsquo;t I know that I don&amp;rsquo;t know? What could be the consequences? I decided to write this blog post and see what happens, as a first step. (Even this step seems pretty gutsy.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the definition of the role and ideal candidate, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go into too much detail here, but ideally as many of the following as possible:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Non-white, non-male, or both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience in companies similar to VividCortex, which is a venture-capital-funded startup that sells infrastructure software to enterprises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leadership experience, preferably as a founder, CEO (or similar), raising venture capital funding, or serving on a board.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A highly technical role, such as chief architect, CTO or similar, ideally in a cloud-hosted SaaS platform that stores and analyzes sensitive customer data.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Experience as a sales or marketing leader, ideally VP- or C-level. Again, if it was for a company that sells to similar buyers as ours, that&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Able to travel to Charlottesville, Virginia (CHO) conveniently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post I&amp;rsquo;ve explained why diversity matters to VividCortex, especially at the board level, and why I believe now is the best time to diversify the board. I&amp;rsquo;ve written from my personal convictions as well as my judgment as a leader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a board member who is different from our current board members. I&amp;rsquo;ve accepted that this will be a more difficult search than simply asking a buddy to join my board. I&amp;rsquo;m fine with that; I&amp;rsquo;m convinced the results will more than justify the effort. I&amp;rsquo;m also fine with this taking the time it takes. Rushing and adding the wrong person to the board would be much worse than having a vacancy for a while. As a startup, statistically speaking we could go belly-up for many reasons, but having a three-member board is not the most likely one in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many challenges to building a diverse team, especially at the board level. In the face of these challenges and the consequences of making the wrong call, the arguments for recruiting someone just like myself, whom I already know well, can seem pretty compelling and rational. But the truth is that after you build a club, changing who&amp;rsquo;s in it comes slowly if at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to say thanks to all the exhausted feminists in my life. Anything I&amp;rsquo;ve done well in this post is pretty much the result of their hard work, and the rest is my fault.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;A few months ago I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/10/11/personality-assessments/&#34;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the DISC and Driving Forces personality assessments I&amp;rsquo;ve been using for the last couple of years, to help me be more intentional about my team interactions and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/dance-dances-itself-using-personality-assessments-hiring-schwartz&#34;&gt;hiring&lt;/a&gt;. This post is about another model I use too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/03/justice.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Justice&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Michael Gorsuch &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/michaelgorsuch/status/703998409674326016&#34;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;ldquo;healthy and effective teams are composed of individuals actively seeking to understand each other&amp;rsquo;s needs.&amp;rdquo; I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have said it better. I find personality assessments helpful in several ways, including assessing candidates and coaching team members. They give people a concrete and consistent language for expressing and understanding themselves and each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;assessments-are-models&#34;&gt;Assessments are Models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All personality assessments express a model of how humans work. Actually, many of them are not about personalities &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s convenient to call them all personality assessments. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment&#34;&gt;DISC&lt;/a&gt; model, for example, is about behaviors, which are pretty easy to observe and validate externally. It&amp;rsquo;s based on William Moulton Marston&amp;rsquo;s psychological theory. There are many other behavioral models, including Myers-Briggs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some models measure motivations instead of behaviors; the one I use and am familiar with is based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Spranger&#34;&gt;Eduard Spranger’s model of human motivation&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen others that include more recent work by Gordon Allport and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motivations aren&amp;rsquo;t externally visible, so in a sense it&amp;rsquo;s actually a deeper model. If you believe in the model, the assessment, and the results, then understanding someone&amp;rsquo;s motivations can help you be more thoughtful about how you hire, train, coach, and manage them. It can help you be more confident in your expectations of how someone will behave or respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example I&amp;rsquo;ve referred to several times is that understanding whether someone tends to be money-motivated is pretty valuable information for hiring salespeople. And if you confirm the assessment&amp;rsquo;s results with the candidate or employee, as I do, then you can collaborate together with them more easily to find the right role where they can shine with less effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;peeling-back-one-more-layer&#34;&gt;Peeling Back One More Layer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If behaviors are superficial, and motivations are their cause, is there an underlying cause for motivations too? It turns out that some scientists believe there is. I&amp;rsquo;m paraphrasing very loosely, but the theory is that motivations are outcomes of values: we care about that to which we assign a high value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can we then model and measure how people value things? Some people believe so. The topic isn&amp;rsquo;t very mainstream in psychology, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lively debate among a handful of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/beyond-good-and-evil/201402/psychological-testing-without-psychological-tests&#34;&gt;passionately interested people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a values assessment for a while. It&amp;rsquo;s based on a mathematical theory called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiology&#34;&gt;Axiology&lt;/a&gt;, and particularly upon Robert S. Hartman&amp;rsquo;s work in developing a &lt;a href=&#34;https://books.google.com/books?id=EK7LBQAAQBAJ&#34;&gt;mathematical science of human values&lt;/a&gt;. Although it is commercialized in various forms, the basis of them all is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hartmaninstitute.org/about/hartman-value-profile/&#34;&gt;Hartman Value Profile&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Hartman Value Profile and its underlying science attempt to measure and model primarily two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How good things are. There&amp;rsquo;s a specific definition related to the description and attributes of those things, combined with how well the attributes and descriptions correspond to the thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How highly people value those things. To the extent that we value good things highly and we devalue bad things, we have clarity about the value of those things.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HVP assessment is subdivided into two parts: external and internal. Each of these is further divided into three dimensions: systemic, extrinsic, and intrinsic. This is difficult to explain clearly; &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.valueinsights.com/axiology3.html&#34;&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; seems to do a pretty good job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment itself is two sets of 18 carefully constructed phrases. You rank the first set according to how good they are, in the purest sense. They&amp;rsquo;re pretty bizarre at first glance, and some of them are pretty hard to rank for many people. It feels like comparing apples to oranges. The second set of phrases are statements you are to rank according to how true or false they are in your specific case. These are equally hard. When you study the science they make more sense, but your first impression is likely to be that they&amp;rsquo;re random and unrelated to each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interpreting the results takes some training. In my opinion, each dimension of each part of the assessment requires quite a bit of thought. For example, one&amp;rsquo;s valuation of other people is called the Empathetic (External Intrinsic). If this is high, you understand other people well. If it is low, you don&amp;rsquo;t understand other people very well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In combination with this, there is a &lt;em&gt;bias&lt;/em&gt; which indicates how much you over- or under-value other people. For example, you could have high clarity about other people, but a negative bias, meaning that you understand people well but are skeptical or hesitant about them (undervalue them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assessment and its results are interesting from several angles, but one of the most compelling to me is the idea that the assessment resists manipulation. Based on the idea that people don&amp;rsquo;t knowingly behave irrationally, the theory goes that someone who has poor clarity into the value of things will be puzzled at how they could be incorrect in their rankings. To give a simple example, a psychopath, who places low value upon another person&amp;rsquo;s life or pain as compared to their whims, would probably defend this choice in all sincerity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;applying-the-hartman-value-profile&#34;&gt;Applying the Hartman Value Profile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With two parts, three dimensions, and the bias (positive, neutral, negative), there are a lot of combinations of things to consider in this assessment! That&amp;rsquo;s why it takes a while to learn to interpret and is so subtle to apply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it worth it, then?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were a jury, I&amp;rsquo;d still be deliberating this. (Irony alert.) However, I have seen it put to very good use in several cases, most notably as a coaching tool. My coach has helped me and others use it to clarify and understand decision-making processes and therefore get to a deeper level of &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; about behaviors and what&amp;rsquo;s likely to happen in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the goal is to help people be &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2016/03/19/meditation/&#34;&gt;self-aware&lt;/a&gt; and thus able to recognize and mitigate their natural tendencies, instead of being controlled by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, one manual for interpretation suggests the following about one of the score combinations, for a person who doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand how systems and processes work and doesn&amp;rsquo;t think they&amp;rsquo;re worthwhile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Systems Judgment: Low Clarity, Negative Bias&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This person is likely confrontational and believes he or she knows better than the boss, especially if a positive self direction is coupled with a high score sense of self. This rebellious attitude may not be a well-informed one. People with this score combination may be a legend in their own minds. This is usually combined with a low awareness of others, which is seen in the empathetic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty detailed indeed! And that&amp;rsquo;s just the analysis of a single one of the dimension/bias combinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it valid? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure yet. I have found &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hartmaninstitute.org/resources/validation-studies/&#34;&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of research showing that the HVP does a very good job and is highly accurate compared to other assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I&amp;rsquo;ve found several cases where different institutions tried to measure which types of assessments could detect most accurately the factors that predicted successful team members. I&amp;rsquo;m aware of several medical schools and the like that have looked at using the HVP in admissions. One is available at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22208827&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; and states &amp;ldquo;The ability to identify unique behavioral, motivational and personal talents that applicants bring to the program that were not identifiable from the traditional application and interview process has allowed us to determine applicants who were a good match for the structure and culture of our program.&amp;rdquo; The people who wrote this research paper were not just bloggers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HVP assessment could potentially be useful to help identify traits and judgment that people try hard to identify in interviews. For example, Mark Roberge, CMO of Hubspot, used regression analysis to find that the top predictor of success as a sales rep was coachability. He &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.hubspot.com/sales/how-to-interview-a-sales-rep-job-candidate-for-coachability&#34;&gt;wrote a blog post&lt;/a&gt; about how to interview for coachability. When I read that blog post through eyes that are familiar with the HVP assessment, it seems quite clear that the characteristics he&amp;rsquo;s looking for appear in the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This American Life&lt;/em&gt; featured the HVP in an &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/231/time-to-save-the-world?act=4&#34;&gt;interesting 15-minute segment&lt;/a&gt;. It focuses more on its use as a tool for discerning good/evil than on applications to the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sharing-results&#34;&gt;Sharing Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always share and collaboratively interpret the DISC and Driving Forces assessment results, even with candidates I don&amp;rsquo;t hire. People always tell me that they enjoy the discussion and found the assessment helpful in learning more about themselves. There are other reasons to share the results, too. It builds trust and comfort in the interview process. Many candidates tell me they&amp;rsquo;ve taken assessments but weren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to see the results, and they felt judged without the chance to know or contest the basis if it were wrong. Imagine being on trial without hearing the charges or evidence against you! Not a good thing to do to a candidate. And finally, my hiring style is thorough and careful, and candidates appreciate that (or, at least, the ones I want to hire do). It&amp;rsquo;s a good way to get the relationship off on the right foot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t always ask candidates to take the HVP assessment, but when I do, I &lt;em&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; share the results. I think the model is too difficult to understand. It would be frustrating and fruitless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I want to pursue a point that the assessment raises, I bring it up with the candidate, but I don&amp;rsquo;t talk about the source. It is easy to point to the Driving Forces or DISC; if it really represents a person&amp;rsquo;s value system and decision-making process, it&amp;rsquo;ll appear there too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m just a beginner with this assessment and am in no way as experienced in it or the underlying science as many others. However, at this point I&amp;rsquo;m impressed enough to keep studying it and learning to interpret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One sad note: Hartman himself, who fled to the US from persecution in Nazi Germany after trying to resist the Nazis, was motivated to develop the calculus of values judgment in order to establish objective criteria for identifying good and evil. It&amp;rsquo;s unfortunate that the most popular application of his theory seems to be in helping businesses make money more efficiently, and not in improving individuals or the human condition; as he &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hartmaninstitute.org/applicationsofaxiology/&#34;&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, then, is our extraordinary opportunity. We may go on spending our money to develop the hydrogen and cobalt bombs and make the scene at Melbourne come true and give the men from Outer Space their opportunity to write the six-volume report, or we may use a fraction of this money – hardly more than the cost of some tiny gadget in an intercontinental missile – to concentrate the energies of a dozen or so people on human survival. The choice is ours, and it may be final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food for thought.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Meditation</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2016/03/19/meditation/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2016 20:14:50 -0400</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2016/03/19/meditation/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling more people about the benefits I&amp;rsquo;ve received from
meditation. Meditation has greatly influenced the way I think, behave, and
relate to others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/03/ripples.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ripples&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t take up meditation for many years was that everyone had a
different definition of meditation. It seemed that in an effort to let people
discover something that worked for them without being overly prescriptive, all
the sources I turned to ended up saying nothing useful about meditation.
Apparently it could be literally anything or nothing. Some said it was thinking
about something, focusing on a mantra or an image; others said it was enjoying
the laughter of children; others a feeling of serenity and calm&amp;mdash;all completely
unhelpful to me. Everyone was talking about it, and the only thing I could
conclude was that none of them were actually doing it. The jargon around it, and
the glib catchphrases, turned me off even more. People seemed to rely on
meaningless phrases  as placeholders for real substance (&amp;ldquo;shine the heart
forward as you connect your breath to your intention and invite your om shanti
to blossom into full expression&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still other people seemed to have urban myth misconceptions, and warned me for
example that I might never &amp;ldquo;come back,&amp;rdquo; telling me about people they knew who&amp;rsquo;d
apparently turned into vegetables or become comatose. I suspect that either
these stories were false or had more to do with other activities, such as heavy
drug use. The idea that someone could short out their brain circuits does not
seem realistic to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation may have many outcomes, such as serenity and clarity, but the goal is
quite simple: to train yourself to observe your own mind and see
reality as it is. By doing this, you realize that you are not your thoughts. You
learn that you are not your &amp;ldquo;self,&amp;rdquo; which in fact is a false identity created by
the thinking part of the mind. You learn that you can &lt;em&gt;be&lt;/em&gt; without &lt;em&gt;thinking&lt;/em&gt;,
that the mind&amp;rsquo;s job is to think, but that mistakenly identifying this activity
as &lt;em&gt;being&lt;/em&gt; is to miss that the mind and its thinking are ripples on the surface
of a deep, still, underlying existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &amp;ldquo;I think, therefore I am&amp;rdquo; mistake is like walking into a room with a
radio blaring and mistakenly believing that the radio is the room. If
you turn off the radio, the room still exists. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably heard some
sentences to the effect of &amp;ldquo;what is the sound of one hand clapping&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;if you
sit in silence, what you hear is the sound of the universe&amp;rdquo; and the like.
They&amp;rsquo;re trying to explain the undescribable, that which can only be explained by
pointing to what it&amp;rsquo;s not: the room is essentially silent, with radio noise
in it. Take away the noise and the silence is still there. Turn the radio
on again and the silence is still there, coexisting with the noise. Others
explain it by saying that the pool is still at the bottom even if there are
ripples on top, or that the sky is always blue above the clouds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation helps you separate your existence from your thinking, which helps you
learn to sense and experience the silence, the blue sky, the stillness at the
bottom of the lake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By training yourself to observe your mind, you become conscious of what it does.
Much of it is useful, but much isn&amp;rsquo;t. And if you are unconscious of these
thoughts, then your mind is in control of you, and not the other way around.
Developing the ability to witness your mind, and know it as something separate,
allows you to be unattached to the mind&amp;rsquo;s cravings, fears, doubts, conditioned
reactions, aversions, delusions, and other misery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s taken me half a dozen years to reach the point I have now. There were many
detours and many false prophets; many people teaching meditation without knowing
it themselves. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve found my way past those, everything is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll give two concrete examples of how meditation has changed me. Some months
ago I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/11/10/what-its-like/&#34;&gt;the agonizing pain and stress of being a
founder&lt;/a&gt;. The company was doing great,
investors were doubling down, customers were flocking to us, the team was
clicking into high gear, I had absolutely nothing to worry about, and yet I was
at the end of my rope. In fact, the better things got, the more exciting and
promising the future looked, the more stressed I was. My mind was getting the
bit between its teeth and running away, with me kicking and screaming along for
the ride. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation helped me realize that my problem was attaching my attention to
thoughts about the future. All of this good news about the company was tempting
me to think about what might happen, what looked likely to happen, what could
be. You who are practiced in meditation already know what I&amp;rsquo;m going to say. I
was taking my mind off the &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; and projecting it into a nonexistent future,
where good things might come to pass&amp;mdash;but then again they might not. For every
potentially good thing about which I could get excited, there was an equal and
opposite fear that it might not happen. In other words, the future is a mental
construct where the mind can project fear, doubt, and worry. It is a fabrication
that the mind creates to facilitate attaching itself and its sense of self-worth
to things that don&amp;rsquo;t even exist, so that it can freak out because they might
never exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example is related to this projection into the future.  The pain and
stress were doubly acute for me because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t used to thinking about the
future. Most of my life, just the opposite was true, and I avoided thoughts of
the future. I spent years in therapy trying to understand and recover from some
traumatic experiences I&amp;rsquo;d had. Every session my therapist would say, &amp;ldquo;Think back
to that time. Tell me about it.&amp;rdquo; The therapist was trying, in a Freudian way, to
help me do the same things as meditation does&amp;mdash;see my reactions to my thoughts
and memories, and disidentify from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation has helped me more in the space of a few months than therapy helped
in years. If I&amp;rsquo;d learned to meditate, I am pretty sure that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t
have needed therapy. And I always felt vaguely sure, in a way I couldn&amp;rsquo;t
explain, that there had to be a more effective way of healing than repeatedly
talking about the horrible things that I&amp;rsquo;d experienced. Now I know what I was
groping for: a more direct and less abstract way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swinging from the past into the future, and experiencing it with a brutal shock,
then becoming aware that this was what was happening to me, taught me that life
must be lived&amp;mdash;indeed, &lt;em&gt;can only&lt;/em&gt; be lived&amp;mdash;in the present moment. The past no
longer exists. If I recall it, I&amp;rsquo;m recreating a memory of the past, and I&amp;rsquo;m
doing it in the now. If I think forward to the future, which likewise does not
exist, I&amp;rsquo;m doing the same thing and I&amp;rsquo;m doing it in the now. The past existed
once, but when it did, it was the now. The future, when it comes to be, will
come to be in the now. Now is the only moment that exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there is no multi-tasking. Attention given to one thing is taken from
another. Attention given to a memory is taken from the now that exists. In other
words, remembering the past or waiting for the future is actually opting not to
live at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meditate is to be in the now, to notice when thoughts arise, and to release
them rather than engaging them. Indulge me as I deploy another bad analogy: when
you&amp;rsquo;re caught up in thoughts, it&amp;rsquo;s as if you&amp;rsquo;re reading the mail; the
independent, outside observer is switched off and attention resides in the
thoughts themselves. When you&amp;rsquo;re observing the thoughts and releasing them, it&amp;rsquo;s
as if you&amp;rsquo;re simply handling or sorting the mail, shuffling it onwards without
opening the envelopes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meditate is to see clearly the mind&amp;rsquo;s activity, the
thoughts, as separate.  It relies for its working on the impossibility of
multi-tasking. You can&amp;rsquo;t stop a thought; the harder you try, the more you&amp;rsquo;re
actually thinking about it. Instead, &lt;em&gt;experiencing&lt;/em&gt; the object of focus (usually
the breath) is a way of taking the focus from the thought and returning it to
the breath. In time, with practice, you realize that there is a &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; that
witnesses either the thought or the breath, and that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; is what you
might call Being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This cannot be achieved by willing it; in fact, will is an exercise of the mind
and only binds you more tightly. You achieve it by relinquishing, releasing,
stepping back, surrendering, accepting, letting go of the will and experiencing
what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation is also &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; what some people commonly say it is. It isn&amp;rsquo;t
relaxation or calm or inner peace (those are potential outcomes). It isn&amp;rsquo;t
thought control, the ability to stop thoughts. It isn&amp;rsquo;t a way to exercise the
mind to achieve greater intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;rsquo;t be explained (and I&amp;rsquo;m not doing it justice), it must be experienced. It
takes time. It takes practice.  It is a training exercise. The goal is to carry
present-moment awareness into every moment, to experience the present rather
than to be a couch potato in the room with the radio, absorbed in the
chatter, missing life as it exists in the present moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To meditate is to train yourself to actually &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt;, to engage, to exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this post reflects my current understanding. Those who are more
advanced than I will surely recognize my errors. To those who are less far along
the path, I hope it is helpful, and leads no one astray.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>The Best Lossy Music Compression</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I noticed recently that Google Play Music has a set of features I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware
of before, and decided to give it a try. Through various kinds of &lt;a href=&#34;http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html&#34;&gt;yak
shaving&lt;/a&gt;,
I ended up tackling a project I&amp;rsquo;d wanted to look into for a while: &lt;strong&gt;which
formats and settings are really the best for lossy music compression?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I learned was both fun and surprising, and ultimately highly practical. If
you&amp;rsquo;re in a hurry, the summary is that high-quality variable-bitrate MP3
produced with the LAME encoder is probably the best all-around choice if you
want broad compatibility; if you want the best sound quality, though, AAC (Apple&amp;rsquo;s native format) or Ogg Vorbis are much better than MP3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before I get to that, let&amp;rsquo;s sharpen some yak razors, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/02/cymatics.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cymatics&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a large library of CDs. Although I listen to more music on Spotify now
than on CD, many of my CDs are esoteric stuff that is not available on Spotify.
For years I&amp;rsquo;ve tried keeping it in various music libraries and players so I can
listen on-the-go. It was never a satisfactory solution. More recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been
an Apple user, and gradually migrated all of my music into iTunes.
Unfortunately, my collection is too large to sync to any mobile device or work
laptop, so unless I&amp;rsquo;m at home, I can&amp;rsquo;t listen to my music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;reevaluating-google-play-music&#34;&gt;Reevaluating Google Play Music&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been aware of several services that let you upload your music library to
the &amp;ldquo;cloud,&amp;rdquo; but was never happy with any of them. It always seemed that I could
get most of what I wanted, but the lacking features were deal-killers in some
way, so the situation remained: Spotify on the go, my personal library at home.
As far as I could see, the choices looked kind of like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spotify: great for subscription-based streaming, cluttered UI, doesn&amp;rsquo;t have
all my music, doesn&amp;rsquo;t support uploading my personal music.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple services and devices: doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit all my music, too expensive, Music
Match doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to actually &lt;em&gt;match&lt;/em&gt; anything, no subscription-based streaming
of stuff I haven&amp;rsquo;t purchased (although that&amp;rsquo;s changed recently). It&amp;rsquo;s been a
while; maybe I should take another look at this too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Cloud Player: doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a good library of stuff to stream, clunky
UI, uploading features don&amp;rsquo;t work well (matching of songs doesn&amp;rsquo;t work).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pandora, et al: niche.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Play Music: wasn&amp;rsquo;t really in my sphere of consciousness.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started with Neil Young. I just got nostalgic for his album &lt;em&gt;Silver and
Gold&lt;/em&gt; one day, and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find it on Spotify. I am an Amazon Prime member, so
I thought to look there, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t available. I own it on CD and didn&amp;rsquo;t want
to buy it again. While looking around to see where I could get it (I wasn&amp;rsquo;t near
my home), I stumbled upon Google Play Music again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Play Music turns out to have a surprisingly nice UI on both the web and
mobile apps, a good library of music for streaming via subscription, and
supports uploading 50,000 songs on the free plan (enough for me). It also
supports offline listening via downloading, and permits exporting files that you
uploaded. Could it be the perfect service?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I&amp;rsquo;m already a longtime Spotify customer, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to switch away
fully to another service like Google Play Music, but I thought perhaps it&amp;rsquo;d be
worth trying it out for uploads only, since that adds $0 to my current monthly
cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I installed the Google Music Manager, let it upload my library, and went on a
trip.  While away, I cued up &lt;em&gt;Silver and Gold&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;ldquo;Good to see you, good to see you
again,&amp;rdquo; it started, and I smiled. Good to see you again too, Neil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then my smile faded. the sound quality was awful! I was so bummed. You might
already know that I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/01/16/bose-sennheiser-sony-noise-cancelling-headphones/&#34;&gt;kind of picky about the sound quality of my
music&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve
taken some care in importing my music into iTunes, and although occasionally I
can hear that a song&amp;rsquo;s quality isn&amp;rsquo;t quite as good as I&amp;rsquo;d like, this was another
matter altogether. It was really painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lossy-compression&#34;&gt;Lossy Compression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someday I&amp;rsquo;d like to &lt;a href=&#34;https://graphics.ethz.ch/teaching/mmcom12/slides/mp3_and_aac_brandenburg.pdf&#34;&gt;learn about lossy compression in detail by reading
Karlheinz Brandenburg&amp;rsquo;s paper &lt;em&gt;MP3 and AAC explained&lt;/em&gt; more
carefully&lt;/a&gt;,
but my current understanding of it is that compression schemes such as MP3, Ogg
Vorbis, and AAC discard portions of the sonic information that the human ear is
less able to hear, in turn introducing errors that are designed to be hard to
hear. These are based on &amp;ldquo;psychoacoustic models,&amp;rdquo; which I interpret in my
layman&amp;rsquo;s terms as factors such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the music is loud, it&amp;rsquo;s harder to hear quiet sounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the music is complicated, we tend to focus on the big themes, not the
details, and we don&amp;rsquo;t hear well at the high and low frequency limits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t hear high and low frequencies well when they&amp;rsquo;re quiet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compression artifacts can be masked by the music itself (and thus inaudible)
if they&amp;rsquo;re quiet enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there are a variety of compression artifacts. For some reason, the one my
ear picks up the most is what I call a &amp;ldquo;swishy&amp;rdquo; sound, which I hear in high
frequencies such as sibilant vowels, cymbals, and the like. When these sounds
change in amplitude, their frequency spectrum seems to change unnaturally if the
compression is too lossy, and I cringe. I may be misinterpreting what&amp;rsquo;s
happening here, but that&amp;rsquo;s how it sounds to my ears: loud cymbals sound bright,
but as they die out, they become muddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also noticed that some songs tend to be hard edge-cases for lossy
compression. For example, David Gray&amp;rsquo;s song &lt;em&gt;Fugitive&lt;/em&gt; requires very high
quality settings to sound good to my ears. It sounds awful at compression
settings that make other songs sound pretty good to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All lossy compression works by throwing away information, so it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising
that these effects show up every so often. I accept that as part of the deal.
But when it&amp;rsquo;s as bad as my Neil Young album sounded, it&amp;rsquo;s unbearable for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have noticed if my original import into iTunes had sounded
this bad. What happened? I speculated that Google Play Music had
transcoded the already-compressed file into another format, adding generation
loss.  I found a &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1100462&#34;&gt;help page on Google Play Music&amp;rsquo;s file format
support&lt;/a&gt; that gave me a
clue: any non-MP3 file is converted to an MP3 file at the same bit rate. Indeed,
the song I was listening to downloaded (exported) as a 128k MP3 file, which is
not very high quality, especially if it has been reencoded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems straightforward to me that the only way to avoid this problem is to
upload MP3 files to Google Play Music in the first place. I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked at my
iTunes library, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure it is a variety of formats, including lots of AAC
files (the iTunes default). I ripped those CDs
over many years with many different programs. I&amp;rsquo;m not eager to throw it away and
do it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;comparing-lossy-compression-formats&#34;&gt;Comparing Lossy Compression Formats&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piqued my curiosity, though: how good are the compression formats, anyway?
I have been interested in lossy compression for many years. I remember being
fascinated when MP3 first appeared on the scene, and learning about alternative
formats such as VQF (TwinVQ), Real Audio.  I remember when WMA arrived, and then
Ogg Vorbis, and the newest contender, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.opus-codec.org/&#34;&gt;Opus&lt;/a&gt;.  The
claimed benefit is usually better sound quality at lower bit rates (smaller file
sizes). My unqualified, untested assumptions were that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;MP3 wasn&amp;rsquo;t very good relative to its successors, but improved over time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vendor-specific formats such as WMA were not much better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ogg Vorbis was very good, but would never be widely accepted as a standard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AAC I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure about. I thought it was a proprietary Apple format; I
was wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While browsing around a bit, an additional nuance caught my attention: the major
MP3 encoding software is the free/opensource LAME and the proprietary, patented
Fraunhofer encoding software. Apparently iTunes uses Fraunhofer software, not
LAME, and it seems that lots of people believe LAME produces better sounding MP3
files than Fraunhofer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I had a thought: leaving aside my subjective opinions of audio
quality, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be hard to get a firm answer on how well various formats
perform. Just encode, then decode and subtract from the original signal, and
look at the resulting errors. Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I need to caveat what follows. It is not that simple. To do that misses
the point of perceptual audio coding to a large extent.  However, it is still
fun and interesting to do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encoded the first 30 seconds of &lt;em&gt;Fugitive&lt;/em&gt; in a variety of formats and
settings. Then I inverted the original signal, and added the original and
decoded signals together. (It&amp;rsquo;s necessary to ensure that the two signals are
exactly aligned in time, or this won&amp;rsquo;t work). This is easy to accomplish in
Audacity. The result is the encoding &lt;em&gt;error&lt;/em&gt;, or roughly the combination of the
signal that&amp;rsquo;s discarded plus signals that the encoder adds (quantization noise
and the like). In a way, it&amp;rsquo;s like the audio version of looking at a
photographic negative overlaid with a positive, seeing what &amp;ldquo;leaks&amp;rdquo; through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Listening to the error signal is interesting. With high quality compression, it
essentially sounds like some high-frequency static, in which you can recognize
the original song&amp;rsquo;s rhythm. At lower quality, it sounds like a muffled version
of the song, with the midrange elided. You can also hear many of the compression
artifacts quite easily, such as dropouts in frequency bands. Two of the most
dramatic examples are the error signals from these compression settings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iTunes using MP3 with custom settings: highest quality, VBR, 96k minimum.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;audio controls&gt;
&lt;source src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/02/itunes-highest-vbr.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;
 Your browser does not support the audio element.
 &lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LAME using 320k constant bit rate.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;audio controls&gt;
&lt;source src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/02/lame-320.mp3&#34; type=&#34;audio/mpeg&#34;&gt;
 Your browser does not support the audio element.
 &lt;/audio&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I combined the channels into mono and amplified the signals by 10dB to make
their waveforms clearer, and took a screenshot of the result. In order, these
are iTunes AAC defaults, iTunes MP3 at fixed 320k bitrate, iTunes default MP3
settings, iTunes MP3 at highest quality preset, iTunes MP3 at highest quality
with VBR at 96k minimum bitrate, LAME at 320k bitrate, LAME at VBR 0 (highest
quality) setting, Ogg Vorbis at Audacity&amp;rsquo;s highest quality setting (10 out of
10), and Ogg Vorbis at Audacity&amp;rsquo;s default quality setting of
5 out of 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/02/waveforms.png&#34; alt=&#34;Waveforms&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more information in the error, the more of the original music is missing or
distorted by added non-music signals. However, it is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; true that this means
the music will sound better. As I said before, the point of perceptual audio
coding as a compression technique is to throw away as much information as
possible, thus &lt;em&gt;adding as much error as possible&lt;/em&gt;, while trying to keep it below
the threshold at which a human can perceive it. If successful, ideally this
actually creates a large error signal but the music still sounds good.
Poor-quality encoders might produce a small error signal but make the music
sound bad. So there isn&amp;rsquo;t a direct relationship between the error signal and the
quality of the music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting way to look at the error signal is as a spectrogram:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/02/spectrogram.png&#34; alt=&#34;Spectrograms&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here it&amp;rsquo;s quite clear that all of the iTunes MP3s are missing a lot of bass.
Contrast the LAME 320 error spectrum to the AAC spectrum, and you can see that
AAC retains a lot more high-frequency data too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-s-the-best-lossy-compression&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s The Best Lossy Compression?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can probably guess that I&amp;rsquo;m going to say this, but it depends.  AAC and Ogg
Vorbis are clearly more advanced than the older MP3 standard, and are capable of
producing better sounding audio at lower bitrates. However, that&amp;rsquo;s not the only
thing you might care about:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compatibility. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why Google Play Music doesn&amp;rsquo;t support AAC
natively, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t. Re-encoding a file from AAC into &amp;ldquo;equivalent
bitrate&amp;rdquo; MP3 files is a terrible idea; the resulting music sounds awful.
Likewise, I&amp;rsquo;d be pretty happy if everyone supported Ogg Vorbis, but that&amp;rsquo;s
never going to happen. (Tangent: I&amp;rsquo;ve heard that Spotify uses Ogg Vorbis.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sweet spot. Although a lot of people seem to believe that 320k MP3 files
are the pinnacle, in reality there&amp;rsquo;s a nonlinear bitrate-versus-quality curve
for both MP3 and AAC compression (and probably others as well.) There&amp;rsquo;s a
point of diminishing returns, after which higher bitrates just make the files
a lot larger without adding much in perceived sound quality. The paper I
linked to earlier has more information on this, and notes that for MP3 the
sweet spot is about 128kbit/s, whereas AAC&amp;rsquo;s sweet spot is a bit lower bitrate
but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t hit as much of a quality ceiling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;File size. This is the whole point, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Constant bitrate files at 320k
aren&amp;rsquo;t very compressed in terms of file size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the topic of file sizes, a 40MB song in WAV format compressed about 4x with
320k MP3, about 5x with the default iTunes AAC format, and a bit more than that
with LAME&amp;rsquo;s V0 setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of audiophiles use lossless compression (which doesn&amp;rsquo;t reduce file size
much), and produce high-quality MP3 or AAC files from them.  For my purposes,
I&amp;rsquo;d like to have&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only one compressed copy of my files (I still have the CDs, after all).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good quality sound even if it&amp;rsquo;s not perfect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Minimal file size.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music available everywhere without horrendous reencoding and other problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, it seems that if I want to use services such as Google Play
Music, my best option is to encode to MP3 with the LAME encoder and a
high-quality variable bitrate such as v0 or v1. (Constant bitrates bloat files
needlessly; lossy compression is designed to achieve a desired perceived
quality, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t always require a lot of bits). However, I have no desire
to reencode tens of thousands of songs in this way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other option I think I need to consider is using Apple&amp;rsquo;s music service instead of
Google&amp;rsquo;s. It supports both AAC and MP3 files as I&amp;rsquo;d expect, and now seems to be
a pretty direct competitor to Spotify and Google&amp;rsquo;s offering. Last time I gave it
a trial, though, the music matching feature didn&amp;rsquo;t match anything, so it was
potentially going to upload &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of my music, which would have exceeded the
limits they had at that point and would have cost me a pretty fair amount of
money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I used Apple&amp;rsquo;s services instead, then my choice would be AAC files, not MP3.
Although MP3 is more broadly compatible, AAC produces clearly better quality
audio in my opinion, without the penalty of larger file sizes. (&lt;em&gt;Update: I now use Apple Music with the Music Library feature, so I get a combination of my personal library with the Apple-hosted cloud-based music catalog. I&amp;rsquo;ve found this to work really, really well; and I haven&amp;rsquo;t had an audio quality problem yet.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In closing, I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with the opening lyrics of &lt;em&gt;Fugitive&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is the answer none of the above&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;About 18 months ago I began an experiment on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/01/snowflake.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;snowflake&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years I have maintained a variety of daily practices I have found helpful to become a better me and manage &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/11/10/what-its-like/&#34;&gt;stress&lt;/a&gt;. These include meditation, prayer, writing, drawing, music, reading a variety of literature including sacred texts, poetry, and self-help (for lack of a better word), and above all else, reflection. I don&amp;rsquo;t always do all of these things every day, and sometimes I move in and out of phases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reflection I seek to understand, in a way that is meaningful to me, whatever external thoughts I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen from others. By doing this I allow all the various aspects of myself to react to these thoughts, and have a sort of internal discussion to enrich and absorb the meaning. My goal is to own the thought for myself, to express it in my own words and feelings. If I can crystallize the thought in the way that&amp;rsquo;s most consequential to me in that moment, I can integrate it into my consciousness and carry it with me through the day and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d become dissatisfied with social media, and I decided that instead of keeping these thoughts to myself, I&amp;rsquo;d share them. My goals were to offset the negativity I saw, balancing it with something more positive; to offer the thoughts for others to do with as they wished; and to let others participate in my own journey, reflecting back to me things I perhaps didn&amp;rsquo;t consider about those thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began using Buffer to share these thoughts at scheduled times on the various social media accounts I use. Although I am sure they look suspiciously like copy-paste from a daily inspirational website, they are more or less original. In any case, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a verse from sacred poetry or a lyric from a pop singer, it&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve made my own in a sort of quiet worship. It&amp;rsquo;s not cheap regurgitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one time I tried working with a remote &amp;ldquo;virtual&amp;rdquo; personal assistant. They suggested that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t spending my time wisely on this, and they offered to take over for me and find and post inspirational messages on my behalf. Of course that would have missed the point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/01/dt130115.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Dilbert&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing such deeply personal reflections has risks and rewards, and my calculus was that the rewards would outweigh the risks. What kinds of risks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accidental coincidences with world events. (I had to hastily unschedule one queued message when there was a tragic event it seemed to respond to.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Misreadings. Or, sometimes, correct readings of something I stated badly and didn&amp;rsquo;t mean the way I wrote.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any type of religious message, intentional or not, that might offend someone with different views.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also knew that I&amp;rsquo;d actually end up exposing parts of myself that others would find unlovable or needing correction. I didn&amp;rsquo;t view this as a risk, but as a reward. Better to find out sooner, and learn and grow, than persist in bigotry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I knew I&amp;rsquo;d occasionally trigger some of the general hatefulness that flourishes on the internet, and tempt the trolls into targeting me. Fortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m a white male American, so I have the privilege of basically feeling immune to that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;ve learned is fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;On the face of it, people generally find those inspirational posts much less interesting than others. My Twitter statistics, for example, show way less engagement and sharing of those tweets. This could reflect the fact that they look like so much other &amp;ldquo;inspirational&amp;rdquo; stuff on social media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten all kinds of responses. People have indeed told me I&amp;rsquo;m in need of improvement, but others have told me they find it deeply meaningful and helpful. Some have thanked me for helping them find hope and comfort in difficult times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some thoughts have had a variety of meanings to different people. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example, where one person had an &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mcfunley/status/668491505590382593&#34;&gt;interesting and completely valid alternative reading&lt;/a&gt; of my inspirational quote. (The ensuing conversation brought up the meaning I&amp;rsquo;d intended.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People read the thoughts not as the thoughts are, but as &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; are. For example, devotees of different faiths sometimes respond in ways that express a sense of identifying me as a member of their faith.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pleased with the results of sharing these thoughts widely and opening them up to other peoples&amp;rsquo; reactions. I feel I&amp;rsquo;ve invited a large group of people to help me grow, and at the same time I&amp;rsquo;ve contributed to them, which is a good thing. When something&amp;rsquo;s caused offense it&amp;rsquo;s often been the source of additional learning and growth for me. And, in studying the reactions to what I share, I find an additional opportunity to reflect back to myself a sense of belonging and similarity: if I were not myself, I&amp;rsquo;d likely react to me just as many others do. We are all so different yet so fundamentally equal in our shared humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These inspirational messages are also related to a set of &amp;ldquo;thought leadership&amp;rdquo; blog posts and other content I&amp;rsquo;ve written or contributed to in the last year. When time permits I&amp;rsquo;ll try to write about what that&amp;rsquo;s taught me, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to read my daily self-inspiration, I invite you to follow me on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/xaprb&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/baron.schwartz&#34;&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://linkedin.com/in/xaprb&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to express my deep gratitude to the hundreds of people who&amp;rsquo;ve inspired me, too, many of you unknowingly.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Feelings and Behaviors</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2016/01/03/feelings-and-behaviors/</link>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a new year and I drew a diagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2016/01/feelings-and-behaviors.png&#34; alt=&#34;Feelings and Behaviors&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This diagram shows the spectra of what I can pay attention to and focus upon.
Along one axis, I can range between focusing on my feelings, or focusing on
other peoples&amp;rsquo; feelings. On the other, I can observe and learn from my actions
and their consequences, or I can notice what others do and what results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This diagram probably means something different to everyone
who reads it, but here&amp;rsquo;s what it means to me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The healthiest people I know tend to care about &lt;strong&gt;what they do and how other
people feel&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The most troubled people I&amp;rsquo;ve known have focused on &lt;strong&gt;how they feel and what
other people do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The other two quadrants are less pathological; more about them later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I drew circles in the top-right and bottom-left because I believe there are
positions of dynamic equilibrium in these locations.  People who live top-right
don&amp;rsquo;t fix their attention unwaveringly on other/self; rather, they move fluidly
between external and internal observation and reasoning. This virtuous cycle is
a dynamic dance of loving, generous relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to live bottom-left, which is a vicious cycle, not a virtuous one. I saw
myself as a helpless victim, against whom the universe and world constantly
plotted.  I spent my time and energy noticing how I felt, ignoring my behaviors,
and blaming my feelings on what other people had &amp;ldquo;done to&amp;rdquo; me.  I modulated
these behaviors only enough to poke my head out of my hole and confirm my
suspicions that I was just a casualty of &amp;ldquo;the system&amp;rdquo; and the deck was all
stacked against me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other two quadrants don&amp;rsquo;t tend to be positions of equilibrium long-term.
Whether a person ends up top-right or bottom-left is a product of many different
possible circumstances, in my experience (N=1).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more regions on this map than I&amp;rsquo;ve shown. For example, there are
people who live top-left in healthy ways. And most people aren&amp;rsquo;t possible to
represent as a point on the map. They occupy some area, usually rather fluidly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m continually inspired by the people around me who live more in the top right
quadrant.  To the extent that I move upwards and rightwards this New Year, I
know I will be the better for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I experience fewer moments of that old bottom-left behavior every New Year than
I did the year before. This is usually because of the choices I make&amp;ndash;much less
so than random events or other peoples&amp;rsquo; actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above all, I can choose where I direct my attention. This is tangible evidence
of what I really value.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>Why Outlook is the best iOS GMail App</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/12/16/outlook-best-ios-gmail-app/</link>
          <pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2015 08:28:38 -0500</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/12/16/outlook-best-ios-gmail-app/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I switched to an iPhone about 6 months ago and have found it superior to the
Android phones I&amp;rsquo;ve used, except for one baffling thing. The GMail app on iOS is
awful compared to the Android version. Unusably awful, actually. Fortunately,
Outlook is very good. Better than the alternatives. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/12/mailboxes.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Mailboxes&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-s-wrong-with-gmail-on-ios&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Wrong With GMail On iOS?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything I was used to and appreciated about the Android GMail app seemed to
be missing or inferior on the iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A global inbox for all my accounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swipe actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highly customizable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten the details now, and I think some of those issues have been
addressed, but every time I&amp;rsquo;ve given it another try some of the things I need
and use constantly are still not there in GMail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put it bluntly, it felt like a beta app from a novice developer. I was
gobsmacked, because the Android app is so damn good. It almost feels like a
different team is working on the iOS app and there is an impenetrable wall
between the two, with zero sharing of information, designs, UI metaphors, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main reasons I liked it on iOS were:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It syncs emails immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Its search is very good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-inbox&#34;&gt;What About Inbox?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inbox is yet another attempt to tell me that email isn&amp;rsquo;t good enough and I
should live my digital life differently. In pursuit of that goal, it removes or
cripples or hides a lot of functionality, while adding a lot of other
functionality I didn&amp;rsquo;t ask for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides that, it&amp;rsquo;s still got a lot of the same issues. It feels like a beta.
Mailbox and other similar apps seemed to have the same problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Update: a few months later, somehow, I started using Inbox and it just clicked.
The only thing I miss is a unified inbox view; I don&amp;rsquo;t like switching between
multiple accounts. I know, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t really fit into the Inbox paradigm.
Anyway, the upshot is I&amp;rsquo;m not using Outlook anymore. I agree, I am a weirdo.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-about-mail-app&#34;&gt;What About Mail.app?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mail.app probably is very well integrated with the iPhone and likely has a great
UI and feature set. But it has this weird feature I don&amp;rsquo;t understand.  It
doesn&amp;rsquo;t receive new mail from the Google servers instantly. Instead, it has to
be set to &amp;ldquo;poll&amp;rdquo; for mail, which is slow and consumes a lot of battery. So your
phone will run out of battery faster and you&amp;rsquo;ll experience delayed email
delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-do-i-like-outlook&#34;&gt;Why Do I Like Outlook?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried a few other apps and settled on Outlook as the best. It handles multiple
accounts well, has a shared/global inbox UI for them, has swipe actions for
things like deleting and archiving, has instant updates with new messages, etc,
etc. It also combines email, calendaring, contacts, and file management
(integrated with Google Drive, Dropbox and the like) in a single app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s not great about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Search. Much of the time when I want to find something, even an email I sent
recently and I know exactly to whom, it simply will not find it. Outlook&amp;rsquo;s
support staff always tells me to reset my account but that does nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a GMail user and own an iPhone, from what I can tell you&amp;rsquo;re just not
going to get the best possible experience. Seems like it&amp;rsquo;s a war of Google
versus Apple, where the elephants are trampling the ants (you and me), and
Microsoft has cleverly realized they have an opportunity to capitalize on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep holding out hope for Google to get their act together and create an
actually respectable email app for the iPhone, but with each new release I still
find myself liking Outlook better.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Minimal Social Meta Tags for a Blog</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/12/13/minimal-social-meta-blog/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 13 Dec 2015 09:14:27 -0500</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/12/13/minimal-social-meta-blog/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;When someone shares your blog article on a social network, odds are it will
appear with some descriptive text, images, and so on. If your blog lacks
explicit instructions, in many cases these properties are just guessed-at and
won&amp;rsquo;t be great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a lot of blog authors and template creators go too far the other
direction and add tons of redundant meta tags, which will make the page larger,
heavier, and slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the minimal necessary set of tags?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/12/sharing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Sharing&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most social media networks recognize various types of meta properties.
Unfortunately, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of redundancy amongst them. Fortunately, most of
them also fall back to an open standard called the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ogp.me/&#34;&gt;Open Graph
protocol&lt;/a&gt;, so you can factor out the repetition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most blogs, and for the most popular social media for sharing informative
articles (Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn), you need the following
properties:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;og:type&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;article&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;og:title&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;{content title, without site title}&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;og:url&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;{permalink}&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;og:image&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;{featured image}&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;og:description&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;{description &amp;lt; 200 chars}&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;og:site_name&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;{site title}&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of these might seem redundant, but for example the URL is required for some
services. In addition, for Twitter you&amp;rsquo;ll need the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;twitter:card&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;{desired card type}&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;quot;twitter:site&amp;quot; content=&amp;quot;{your @username}&amp;quot; /&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With those eight meta tags you&amp;rsquo;re all set for most content-related sharing.
Other social media services, such as Pinterest, have additional tags they
require, and sometimes processes you need to follow to be whitelisted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the social media services have a) documentation and b) validators to
preview how things will appear. Here are documentation links:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.twitter.com/cards/markup&#34;&gt;https://dev.twitter.com/cards/markup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters&#34;&gt;https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/46687/~/making-your-website-shareable-on-linkedin&#34;&gt;https://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/46687/~/making-your-website-shareable-on-linkedin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developers.google.com/+/web/snippet/&#34;&gt;https://developers.google.com/+/web/snippet/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many cases your content sharing instructions won&amp;rsquo;t be honored until you use
the validator to check it. Checking triggers re-scraping and serves as a
whitelisting process for several of the networks.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>How to Extract Data Points From a Chart</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/12/06/get-data-points-from-chart/</link>
          <pubDate>Sun, 06 Dec 2015 19:38:48 -0500</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/12/06/get-data-points-from-chart/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I often see benchmark reports that show charts but don&amp;rsquo;t provide tables of
numeric results. Some people will make the actual measurements available if
asked, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been interested in
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vividcortex.com/resources/universal-scalability-law/&#34;&gt;analyzing&lt;/a&gt;
many systems for which I can&amp;rsquo;t get numbers.  Fortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s usually possible
to get approximate results without too much trouble. In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;ll show
several ways to extract estimates of values from a chart image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/12/espresso.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Extracting&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll motivate the idea with a simple chart of a slide I saw at the recent
PGConfSV conference on a keynote presentation. I was interested in the benchmark
data (for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.citusdata.com/&#34;&gt;CitusDB&lt;/a&gt;, in this case) but I am sure
they are busy and I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten in touch with them yet about it. So I watched
the YouTube video of the keynote address, paused it when the slide was showing,
and took a screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/12/citusdb-benchmark.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;CitusDB Benchmark Result&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to use the Universal Scalability Law to analyze the chart on the left
and estimate how much of CitusDB&amp;rsquo;s massively parallel processing is serialized.
I am not an expert on it, but I believe it uses a PostgreSQL node with a plugin
as a query planner and router, sends queries to shards containing data, and
combines the results to return them to the client. This is fairly standard
scatter-gather processing. One of the big limiting factors for such a system is
typically the query planning and the merging of the results. How much of the
overall execution time does that take? The Universal Scalability Law can help
understand that. But to analyze the system, first I need its data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how to get it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;doing-it-the-hard-way&#34;&gt;Doing It The Hard Way&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you two hard ways to do this and suggest a couple of easier
ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One is to use any photo editing software and a ruler or crop function to
estimate the pixel center of the points on the chart. For example, here&amp;rsquo;s a
screen capture of dragging from the bottom left of the image to the bottom left
of the chart to get an X-Y point for the intersection of the chart&amp;rsquo;s X and Y
axes. I&amp;rsquo;m using the default Mac image editing program here, Preview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/12/using-preview.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Using Preview To Estimate Points&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is X=326,Y=183. Do this repeatedly for all the points on the chart
and then put the results into a spreadsheet, subtract the origin X and Y from
all the points, and normalize them relative to known points on the chart axes
(which you should also measure) and you&amp;rsquo;ve got your results. Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot
of the spreadsheet I made to do this. The points I measured are in green and the
results are in purple:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/12/points-spreadsheet.png&#34; alt=&#34;Spreadsheet to calculate results&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/12/spreadsheet.xlsx&#34;&gt;download the spreadsheet&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;d
like to look at it.
It&amp;rsquo;s quite clear from the chart&amp;rsquo;s context that the X-values should actually be
1, 5, 10 and 20 so those are easy corrections to make.
Using this technique I estimate the points as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; 1   36250
 5  110000
10  195000
20  313750
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A similar technique is to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.desmos.com&#34;&gt;Desmos&lt;/a&gt;. You can insert
an image, set its dimensions equal to its pixel count, then create a table and
use the gear menu to enable dragging on the table&amp;rsquo;s points, turning on the 4-way
drag handles. Then align points over the chart&amp;rsquo;s points, and you can read off
the values from the table just as with the Preview app:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/12/using-desmos.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Using Desmos&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One nice thing about this method is that you can then combine the image with any
graphs you&amp;rsquo;re making. For example, I used this method to facetiously analyze the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vividcortex.com/blog/2015/11/28/a-trendline-is-a-model/&#34;&gt;path of the eclipsing
moon&lt;/a&gt; on a
recent blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;easier-ways&#34;&gt;Easier Ways&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why use hard methods like that? I believe the hard ways are still valuable to
know about. First of all, when you do it you get a firm grasp on the math and
you&amp;rsquo;re tuned in to what you&amp;rsquo;re working on (or I am, at least). Second, sometimes
when charts are skewed by, say, the camera&amp;rsquo;s perspective, you have to estimate
where the points would fall if the skew were corrected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, there are a few tools that are easier to use and produce good
results. While searching online I found
&lt;a href=&#34;http://digitizer.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;engauge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.datathief.org/&#34;&gt;Data
Thief&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;di8itapp&#34;&gt;http://di8itapp.com/&lt;/a&gt;. But the
best one I&amp;rsquo;ve found so far is the free online &lt;a href=&#34;http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/app/&#34;&gt;web plot
digitizer&lt;/a&gt;, which runs in the
browser and produced quite good results for me. It allows very fine control over
the placement of the points. The extracted points are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; 0.995104673   32858.00211
 5.070422535  108307.8542
10.07535128   196097.94
20.17810302   312738.7098
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the X-points should be set to 1, 5, 10, and 20 as before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, this app integrates with &lt;a href=&#34;https://plot.ly&#34;&gt;Plotly&lt;/a&gt;, and can
automatically send the resulting data points there for analysis. Plotly is a
tool I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware of previously. I found it quite nice for this type of
analysis and was able to quickly run a regression against the USL and estimate
the coefficient of serialization at 4% and the coefficient of crosstalk at 0,
which is very realistic for this type of system in my experience:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/12/plotly.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Plotly&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That was easy! Easier than using RStudio, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the techniques I showed in this article you can extract graph points from
a variety of different images when you lack the source data. Some of these
techniques are easier to use on large datasets than others, and some are just
more fun if you feel like doing things manually, but all can produce results
good enough for many purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about the analysis of CitusDB, and what it means for it to
have a coefficient of serialization (sigma) of about 4%, please read my
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vividcortex.com/resources/universal-scalability-law/&#34;&gt;introduction to the Universal Scalability
Law&lt;/a&gt;. If
you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you&amp;rsquo;ll find it fascinating that such a model exists. (Exercise
for the reader: what&amp;rsquo;s the maximum speedup CitusDB should be able to achieve as
you add more nodes to it?)&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi! I probably don&amp;rsquo;t know you, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to make this blog better for you. If
you&amp;rsquo;re disabled&amp;mdash;for example, perhaps you use a screen reader, a special
device, or have other needs that I might not anticipate, I&amp;rsquo;d really love your
feedback on what I can do to make my content easier for you to read and enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/wilderness.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Wilderness&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of things I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about recently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use a screen reader, does the navigation or other stuff get in the way?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use some device to do something like, I dunno, convert my RSS feed to
podcasts and listen in the subway, how well does that work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I do if I want to include a complicated equation? Use an image,
use something like MathJax, mark it as skippable for screen readers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I include images, does it matter what I name them? How good of an
experience is the image I included above?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can I do to make links easier to use? Should I have meta tags like &amp;ldquo;next&amp;rdquo;
and &amp;ldquo;previous&amp;rdquo; and so on? Should I always add link titles or something?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to link to a couple of recent articles and ask you what I could have
done better to make them easier for people-who-are-not-like-me. Here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/11/12/universal-scalability-law-teach-mysql/&#34;&gt;article
1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/11/10/what-its-like/&#34;&gt;article
  2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>What Does The Universal Scalability Law Reveal About MySQL?</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/11/12/universal-scalability-law-teach-mysql/</link>
          <pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2015 21:00:39 -0500</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/11/12/universal-scalability-law-teach-mysql/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of weeks, there have been a few blog posts about benchmarks
comparing the performance of various versions of MySQL and variants such as
MariaDB. There&amp;rsquo;s also been some analysis of the results using formal models such
as Neil Gunther&amp;rsquo;s Universal Scalability Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What can the Universal Scalability Law (USL) teach us about the performance
characteristics of these systems, as revealed by the benchmarks? To find out,
I&amp;rsquo;ll examine one particular benchmark, &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mariadb.org/maria-10-1-mysql-5-7-commodity-hardware/&#34;&gt;MariaDB 10.1 and MySQL 5.7 performance
on commodity hardware&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/chicken.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;chicken&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The context for this benchmark, in a nutshell, is that MySQL 5.7 was just
released as GA, and the published performance results are spectacular, from the
point of view of throughput on large servers. Although this is good, showing
that MySQL can scale to do lots of work on large servers, the MariaDB
benchmarkers wanted to understand how a simple benchmark would run on a typical
commodity server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benchmark compares several versions of MySQL. Neil
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DrQz/status/658628244413878272&#34;&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; an analysis
of the benchmark with the USL:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/usl-njg-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;usl-njg-1&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful with that chart, because the horizontal axis is log-scaled, not
linear. What can we learn from that? First of all, if you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with the
USL at all you&amp;rsquo;ll instantly recognize that the system isn&amp;rsquo;t behaving as the USL
predicts. A much better way to model this is to use only the first few
datapoints to predict what might happen if the system didn&amp;rsquo;t encounter the
limitation we can see beginning at 8 connections. Neil &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DrQz/status/658774806578335744&#34;&gt;did this
too&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/usl-njg-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;usl-njg-2&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neil&amp;rsquo;s commentary, which I&amp;rsquo;ll paraphrase for clarity, is *If you can remove the
bottleneck at 118k queries per second, the USL predicts that the system will hit
a ceiling around 250k queries per second. Can MySQL or MariaDB get there? If
not, why not? With the USL, it&amp;rsquo;s no longer OK to just measure, you have to
&lt;strong&gt;EXPLAIN&lt;/strong&gt; the data.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The explanation is simple. The server has 4 cores and 8
threads:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel Xeon E5 E5–1630v3   4/8t  &lt;br&gt;
3,7 / 3,8 GHz 64  GB RAM&lt;br&gt;
DDR4 ECC 2133 MHz 2 ×2TB  SOFT&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This server can run only 8 queries simultaneously. After that, adding
more connections trying to run queries is not going to improve things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USL doesn&amp;rsquo;t include parameters that model the fixed size of underlying
hardware and other resources, and as a result, it&amp;rsquo;s very common to find some
type of resource saturation that creates a ceiling it doesn&amp;rsquo;t predict. This is a
perfect example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I discuss in my new &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vividcortex.com/resources/universal-scalability-law/&#34;&gt;50-page ebook on the
Universal Scalability Law&lt;/a&gt;,
it&amp;rsquo;s rather pointless to try to use the USL to assess behavior beyond a
saturation point such as the one you can see in this benchmark. That&amp;rsquo;s why
fitting the USL to the data up to and including 8 connections is the right
approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the saturation point, all you can see is whether, under increased queue
length, the server stays efficient or wastes effort.  Most servers lose
efficiency. To find out exactly what causes this, please read the ebook I linked
above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The charts above are all of several versions of the server analyzed together. I
think it&amp;rsquo;s a better idea to analyze only a single version of the server. Let&amp;rsquo;s
look at the results for MySQL 5.6.27 only, because on this benchmark it beat the
other versions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
clients qps
1 24456
2 45314
4 78024
8 126892
16 129029
32 127780
64 125526
128 124158
256 116337
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the USL analysis of this data up to 8 clients:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/usl.png&#34; alt=&#34;USL&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s such a small &lt;em&gt;kappa&lt;/em&gt; coefficient that it should be ignored, however,
&lt;em&gt;sigma&lt;/em&gt; is about 7.4%, which is quite significant and limits performance very
seriously. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with the USL this provides concrete ideas about
what needs to be changed, and defines how far you can scale this server on this
type of configuration. When I was at Percona in the 2009-2011 timeframe we made
a business out of finding and alleviating those kinds of bottlenecks,
which is what led to XtraDB and eventually to Percona Server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Takeaways:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a system hits an obvious ceiling, don&amp;rsquo;t try to fit the USL to the data
beyond that point. Especially when you know the hardware explains the
behavior simply.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens beyond that point does indicate something about the server&amp;rsquo;s
ability to go beyond saturation without completely spitting its cereal. We
see essentially a flatline here, but in older versions of MySQL we used to
see serious retrograde scalability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The USL&amp;rsquo;s parameters point you in the right direction to find and fix
scalability problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are lots of weird and contradictory results for lots of benchmarks.
Benchmarketing is everywhere. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vividcortex.com/resources/universal-scalability-law/&#34;&gt;Learn about the Universal Scalability
Law&lt;/a&gt; and
innoculate yourself against lots of brain twisters.&lt;/li&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;At Velocity/OSCON 2015 in Amsterdam a couple of weeks ago, the conference
committee approached me to ask if I&amp;rsquo;d be up for doing an Ignite talk. It was
rather last-minute and I had only hours to prepare. I said yes and then tried to
think of a topic. I turned to Twitter and asked, if you could have me talk for 5
minutes on any topic, what would it be? A couple of people responded that they
wanted to know what founding a company was like, so I sat down in the speaker
lounge at the RAI and started trying to figure out what it&amp;rsquo;s like to be a
founder/CEO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;d think I&amp;rsquo;d know after three years, but truthfully, it&amp;rsquo;s still hard to
really know what I feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Ignite&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I did it. I sent O&amp;rsquo;Reilly twenty slides of uncaptioned
&lt;a href=&#34;http://unsplash.com/&#34;&gt;images&lt;/a&gt; that moved through an arc, and tried to write a
story I could tell on stage. If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Ignite, it&amp;rsquo;s a format
in which exactly twenty slides advance automatically after fifteen seconds each,
for a total of five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to wing it to some extent, and while speaking I thought one of the
slides might even have gotten lost in the void of the internet and I had to skip
some stuff I&amp;rsquo;d planned (it was really confusing to see what slide was on
screen), but I got through it. Below I&amp;rsquo;m sharing my notes&amp;mdash;which I did not
exactly follow, because I changed things until the moment I spoke&amp;mdash;and at the
end is a video of the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a founder/CEO or similar, and you&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about your struggles,
I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to reach out to me or to peers. (I can&amp;rsquo;t be available for
everyone, but if you&amp;rsquo;re desperate you need to talk to someone.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The working title of the talk was either &amp;ldquo;What it&amp;rsquo;s like&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Why I do this&amp;rdquo; or
something similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, enough preamble, let&amp;rsquo;s do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-i-choose-technology&#34;&gt;Why I Choose Technology&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00001.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago my friend Eliane asked why I love databases, and it took me years to
answer. I always loved knowing how things work. I used to disassemble clocks and
put them back together. Eventually I realized that technology is how I express
my creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;creative-expression&#34;&gt;Creative Expression&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00002.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00002.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creativity is a vital part of being human. All forms of expression are equally
valid: dance, music, art, writing, athletics, coding. Whatever you love,
whatever brings you alive, is valid. That includes being a nerd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-importance-of-creativity&#34;&gt;The Importance of Creativity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00003.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00003.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creativity is self actualization. It&amp;rsquo;s how we express agency in the world. It&amp;rsquo;s
how we say &amp;ldquo;I am alive and I choose to live, not just exist.&amp;rdquo; I want this for
you, and for me, all of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-i-founded-a-company&#34;&gt;So I Founded A Company&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00004.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00004.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three years ago I founded company to amplify my personal mission, to give to
others what I wanted for myself: a life of purpose and validation that being a
nerd is just as honorable as being a sculptor. I speak today because I want to
share this experience with others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-s-it-like-being-a-founder&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s It Like Being A Founder?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00005.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00005.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a word, stressful. Words to describe it don&amp;rsquo;t really exist. It&amp;rsquo;s a roller
coaster from fear to joy and back, sometimes every 20 minutes. I can describe
specific dimensions of the experience, but it&amp;rsquo;s like becoming a parent. You have
to live it to know it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;demands-from-everywhere&#34;&gt;Demands From Everywhere&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00006.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00006.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone wants something from me. Customers, employees, investors, community,
family, vendors, governments. The amount of time and energy left over for myself
is very small. Personal and company demands are often in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-comfort-zone&#34;&gt;No Comfort Zone&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00007.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00007.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My comfort zone is mostly off-limits now. I am a reserved person, but I must be
outgoing. I prefer to support people, now I must sometimes challenge them. I&amp;rsquo;m a
single-tasking focuser, now I have to multitask. I deny myself the pleasure of a
job well done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;compounding-effects&#34;&gt;Compounding Effects&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00008.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00008.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to find time or motivation for exercise. I constantly forget things
and people. This becomes a self-reinforcing negative spiral quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sleep-is-elusive&#34;&gt;Sleep Is Elusive&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00009.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00009.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wake and cannot deal with intrusive thoughts and a racing pulse. At
2 in the morning, jacked on adrenaline and fear, I&amp;rsquo;m not solving anything. When
I do sleep I have repetitive dreams of being late and unprepared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a founder and CEO forces me to constantly destroy the old person I used
to be. He is no longer what I need. He got me to this point, but now the task
is to systematically amputate the parts I do not want and grow new ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is way beyond &amp;ldquo;productivity tips&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;life hacking.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s self
transformation. This is what it means to be committed. The only way through it
is through it. It&amp;rsquo;s often a brutal process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-much-to-lose&#34;&gt;So Much To Lose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00013.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00013.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s hard to ask for help because there&amp;rsquo;s so much to lose. Everyone is looking
for the slightest sign of weakness or fault. Honestly admitting a shortcoming
could mean not winning a customer or investor, losing an employee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;loneliness&#34;&gt;Loneliness&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not alone in the struggle, but I&amp;rsquo;m lonely. Most founders suffer in silence
and isolation. Depression, sickness, addiction, breakdowns and even suicide
are the result. It&amp;rsquo;s rare for founders to break the silence. I&amp;rsquo;m doing it
today because we deserve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;not-impostor-syndrome&#34;&gt;Not Impostor Syndrome&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s popular right now to talk about impostor syndrome, but this isn&amp;rsquo;t impostor
syndrome. This is real and honest. This is a valid experience. I take comfort
knowing that my discomfort with this unnatural experience is an appropriate
response to the position I&amp;rsquo;m in. If you are feeling the same thing, know that
you&amp;rsquo;re not damaged goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To cope and adapt, I have to make an effort to help myself and ask others to
help me. I begin each day by dedicating myself to the service of something
greater than myself. I resolve to be fully alive, present in the moment, and
to suppress my self-will. I read sacred literature. I journal. Then I go do my
best. I end the day by forgiving myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;meditation&#34;&gt;Meditation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/ignite-00017.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ignite-00017.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation is a huge part of what keeps me sane. Meditation does not still my
mind or stop the intrusive thoughts. It helps me notice and accept what is
happening to me, within me, and around me. I worked with an architect, an old
man with a lifelong transcendental meditation practice, for years. But I lost
it. I had to find a system that actually worked for me. The Headspace book and
app helps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;asking-for-help&#34;&gt;Asking For Help&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also ask for help. I&amp;rsquo;ve reached out to a lot of other founders and talked.
They may not know it but they&amp;rsquo;ve made a huge difference for me. I hope you
reach out to me if you need help, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;working-as-a-team&#34;&gt;Working as a Team&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also had to learn to stop trying to do everything myself. I have a team
of people who are better at their jobs than I am. I don&amp;rsquo;t ask them to be my
confidantes, but they support me whether they know it or not. And I have
advisors, mentors, and a professional coach who make it easier day by day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate-conclusion-1-you-make-a-difference&#34;&gt;Alternate Conclusion 1: You Make A Difference&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounds hard. Why do I do it? I do it because of you. You are here for a
purpose. You have impact. The world needs you and cannot replace you. You make
a difference. But really, I do it for you because doing it for you is doing it
for myself. I must be to the world what I want the world to be for me. I get
back more than I give. My lows are lower, but my highs are higher too. Thank
you. &lt;em&gt;[I wanted to end with a note of inspiration and encouragement, gesturing
towards each person&amp;rsquo;s irreplaceable role in life, but I changed this ending at
the last moment.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;alternate-conclusion-2-why-do-i-do-it&#34;&gt;Alternate Conclusion 2: Why Do I Do It?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the product, company, and the team serve a greater good. It&amp;rsquo;s
true that it&amp;rsquo;s hard, but I believe I must be what I want to see in the world.
My low times are worse, but my highs are higher. &lt;em&gt;[I chose this ending because I
thought the note of encouragement, although important and true, was not
consistent with the rest of the talk. The sentiment of the first alternative
ending still holds, though.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <title>Setting Thresholds With Quantiles</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/11/07/setting-thresholds-with-quantiles/</link>
          <pubDate>Sat, 07 Nov 2015 19:39:36 -0500</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/11/07/setting-thresholds-with-quantiles/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I was talking with someone the other day about a visualization I remembered
seeing some years ago, that could help set a reasonable value for a threshold on
a metric. As I&amp;rsquo;ve
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vividcortex.com/blog/2013/04/10/2-reasons-why-threshold-based-monitoring-is-hopelessly-broken/&#34;&gt;written&lt;/a&gt;,
thresholds are basically a broken way to monitor systems, but if you&amp;rsquo;re going to
use them, I think there are simple things you can do to avoid making threshold
values &lt;em&gt;completely&lt;/em&gt; arbitrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the place I&amp;rsquo;d seen the visualization (if you know prior art for
the below, please comment!) so I decided to just blog about it. Suppose you
start off with a time series:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/time-series.png&#34; alt=&#34;time series&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that you might want to alert on this metric breaking some threshold,
but what&amp;rsquo;s the right value? There are lots of ways you could do it: a multiple
of the average, some quantile, some number of standard deviations from the mean,
etc, etc. For example, you could say &amp;ldquo;I want to alert if the metric exceeds its
usual 99.9th percentile.&amp;rdquo; But isn&amp;rsquo;t 99.9 an arbitrary number, too? What makes it
so special? Is there &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; way to pick a number that isn&amp;rsquo;t just pulled out of a
hat?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need to preface all of this with a disclaimer. Everyone&amp;rsquo;s systems are
different, static thresholds are silly, quantiles are known to the state of
California to cause cancer, and so on. What I&amp;rsquo;m about to show you is only
&lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; less arbitrary. Don&amp;rsquo;t confuse it for a rule that actually has a
strong reason why it&amp;rsquo;s better than the alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is to look at the &lt;em&gt;shape&lt;/em&gt; of your data and use that to decide where you
feel is the right threshold. The &amp;ldquo;shape&amp;rdquo; is the distribution of the data&amp;ndash;how
its values are typically spread.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to do that is to plot the quantiles. In the following plot,
the quantiles go from left to right. At the far left is the 0th percentile, and
at the far right is the 100th percentile. Another way to say that is the left is
the minimum value and the right is the maximum value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/quantiles.png&#34; alt=&#34;quantiles&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made no effort to polish this chart; you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that I generated the
quantiles by taking a vector of 1000 numbers and dividing it by 1000, for
example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, as you look at this chart, you can see that near the far right, it suddenly
jumps&amp;ndash;it has an elbow. Let&amp;rsquo;s zoom in on the last 10% of the chart, i.e. the 90th
percentile and above:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/11/95-percent.png&#34; alt=&#34;95th percentile&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing magical about this elbow. There&amp;rsquo;s nothing magical about the last
10 percent of values. It just so happens that those last few are
disproportionately larger than the rest. In simple terms, it means that the
system&amp;rsquo;s model, or perhaps the parameters for its model, apparently changed.
And if you&amp;rsquo;re going to pick a place to alert on a threshold, maybe a point where
the behavior diverges rapidly is as good as any and better than some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, you could put your threshold just at the point where the
quantile plot gets steeper, which is about the value 1600 in this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all data behaves this way. Some metrics will have a nice line all the way up
and to the right, with no elbow. Some will jump sooner. Some will have a big
ledge, even several ledges. You&amp;rsquo;ll get all kinds of different shapes and sizes
of data. The point is to at least &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; what shapes and sizes your own data
has.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visualizations like this have a lot of explanatory power and can show you
potentially surprising things very easily. That&amp;rsquo;s why this kind of
visualization, rather than just the standard boring time series plot, is not a
bad thing to know how to do. It&amp;rsquo;s not revolutionary, things like this are used
in all sorts of ways and by lots of people. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q%E2%80%93Q_plot&#34;&gt;QQ
plots&lt;/a&gt;, for example, are a
related technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m probably repeating myself too much, but again this is nothing special,
but it&amp;rsquo;s something anyway. With this approach, there still may not be a strong
justification for choosing a number as a threshold, but at least there&amp;rsquo;s a
reason and method, and it&amp;rsquo;s better than cargo cult, a random number generator,
or copy-and-paste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the R code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;perf &amp;lt;- read.csv(&amp;quot;/path/to/perf.csv&amp;quot;, sep=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;)
plot(perf$tput)
plot(c(1:1000), quantile(perf$tput, probs=c(1:1000)/1000))
plot(c(900:1000), quantile(perf$tput, probs=c(900:1000)/1000))
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Related: someone on Twitter pointed me to &lt;a href=&#34;http://apmblog.dynatrace.com/2012/11/14/why-averages-suck-and-percentiles-are-great/&#34;&gt;this blog post from Dynatrace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <pubDate>Fri, 23 Oct 2015 13:52:35 -0400</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/10/23/pgconfsv-postgresql-conference/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t heard about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pgconfsv.com/&#34;&gt;PGConfSV&lt;/a&gt; yet, it&amp;rsquo;s a
conference for the Silicon Valley PostgreSQL community and beyond, featuring
leading PostgreSQL performance and scalability experts. It&amp;rsquo;s happening November
17-18 at the South San Francisco Conference Center. I encourage everyone in the
area to attend, since this is likely to be the best Postgres conference held
thus far in the Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also urge you to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pgconf-silicon-valley-2015-tickets-16521286613&#34;&gt;buy your tickets&lt;/a&gt; before they sell out! Of course, the earlier
you buy, the more you save, too. (Use SeeMeSpeak for a 20% discount).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/10/ssfcc.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Convention Center&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll be at the conference along with some of my colleagues. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty excited
about this for a few reasons. Allow me to &amp;lsquo;splain why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2008/04/01/postgresql-conference-east-2008/&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve loved PostgreSQL for a long
time&lt;/a&gt; although fate has
mostly seen me work in the MySQL community. I&amp;rsquo;ve attended, spoken, helped
organize and otherwise been involved in a handful of Postgres events, and this
conference brings back a lot of good memories and anticipation. Among other
things, Terry Erisman is one of the principal organizers and he does a
&lt;em&gt;fantastic&lt;/em&gt; job of overseeing conferences. Seriously. He&amp;rsquo;s one of the big
reasons the MySQL conference not only continued, but rebounded after the dark
days of the Sun acquisition. PostgreSQL fans should be thrilled to have him
involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vividcortex.com/&#34;&gt;VividCortex&lt;/a&gt; is a sponsor, so I&amp;rsquo;ll be
there in an official capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&amp;rsquo;m
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pgconfsv.com/sessions/analyzing-postgresql-network-traffic-vc-pgsql-sniffer&#34;&gt;speaking&lt;/a&gt;
about sniffing the network protocol off the wire and analyzing it. If you&amp;rsquo;ve
seen any of my talks about &amp;ldquo;finding hidden treasures in TCP traffic&amp;rdquo; kinds of
topics, hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll have an idea of what might be in store in that talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also participated in an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.citusdata.com/blog/25-terry/261-pgconf-silicon-valley-speaker-baron-schwartz-vividcortex-%E2%80%8E&#34;&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt;
leading up to the conference, on why I&amp;rsquo;m so excited not only about this
particular event, but also why I&amp;rsquo;m more and more excited about PostgreSQL in
general. As a community and as a technology, it&amp;rsquo;s really exploding onto the
scene in ways a lot of people don&amp;rsquo;t appreciate yet. (But they will!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Come be a part of the next big sea change in opensource relational databases!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

          <title>The Case For Tagging In Time Series Data</title>
          <link>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/10/16/time-series-tagging/</link>
          <pubDate>Fri, 16 Oct 2015 20:04:28 -0400</pubDate>
          <author></author>
          <guid>https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2015/10/16/time-series-tagging/</guid>
          <description>&lt;p&gt;A while ago I wrote a blog post about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2014/06/08/time-series-database-requirements/&#34;&gt;time series database
requirements&lt;/a&gt; that has been
amazingly popular. Somewhere close to a dozen companies have told me they&amp;rsquo;ve
built custom in-house time series databases, and that blog post was the first
draft of a design document for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things I said in the post was that I had no use for the &amp;ldquo;tagging&amp;rdquo;
functionality I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in time series databases such as OpenTSDB. I&amp;rsquo;ve since
reconsidered, although I think the functionality I now want is a bit different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/10/tagged.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;tagged&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to &amp;ldquo;tag&amp;rdquo; metrics? Typically, many time series databases let
you add name=value pairs (tags) to individual time series points (observations).
For example, you measure CPU usage to be 59% at 3:41PM on host inst413, and you tag
this measurement as &amp;ldquo;shard=81&amp;rdquo; because inst413 holds data for shard 81.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use case for this is that you can now aggregate and filter metrics, looking
at for example CPU usage for all of the shard 81 hosts at a point in time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tags are typically attached to individual points in the systems I&amp;rsquo;m aware of,
rather than being attached to a host or similar, because the assumption is that
they&amp;rsquo;ll change over time. You might move shard 81&amp;rsquo;s data to a different set of
servers. You might destroy host inst413 and rebuild it, and it might not even be
a database anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my purposes at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vividcortex.com/&#34;&gt;VividCortex&lt;/a&gt;, I want &amp;ldquo;tags&amp;rdquo; to
help slice-and-dice-and-filter for a variety of customer scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We currently can show you Top Queries by total time, and Top Queries by the
count of queries that lack indexes. Customers want to see Top
Queries by total time, filtered to show only those that lack indexes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We can show you Top Users by total time, indicating the total service demand
placed on a set of hosts by queries running against them from a particular
user. But what our customers want is to see Top Queries by total time,
filtered to those that come from a specific user.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of cases where we want to decouple the metrics from the
filtering that can be applied to them. Some we can support by joining together
related metrics, at some cost on our backend; some we cannot currently do as
well as we want, or in the way we want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I do not like one thing about the common tagging functionality. I don&amp;rsquo;t
like that individual metric points all have to bear the burden of every tag for
every point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I view tags as &lt;em&gt;time series facts that exist during some time
interval.&lt;/em&gt; And I think these should be applicable to the metric or the host (but
I don&amp;rsquo;t see a use case where I want them per point in a metric). For example,
a query doesn&amp;rsquo;t use an index. I can tag the query&amp;rsquo;s metrics as &amp;ldquo;no_index=true&amp;rdquo;
from the timestamp I first observe that, till the timestamp that I observe it
using an index. These durations can be open-ended, in which case they apply for
all time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I can tag the host as &amp;ldquo;shard=81&amp;rdquo; during the time that this host
carried that shard&amp;rsquo;s data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the tags need to permit multiple values. Imagine a query that is run by
several different users; we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want a uniqueness constraint on it.
&amp;ldquo;user=nagios&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;user=vividcortex&amp;rdquo; should be able to coexist for the query

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last couple of years I have increasingly studied and used personality tests for personal and professional uses, both for myself and for others. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a variety of benefits, but these assessments are not without drawbacks, and not all assessments are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/10/different.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;different&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personality assessments, at their finest, are statistical tools created and validated by teams of psychologists and mathematicians. At their worst, they are snake oil, invented and promoted by people with no real expertise, and claimed to achieve results that stretch credibility, sometimes even though they&amp;rsquo;ve been repeatedly shown not to work. There are many shades of gray in between: tests that work okay but are difficult to interpret, tests that show results that aren&amp;rsquo;t really actionable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-assessments-good-for&#34;&gt;What Are Assessments Good For?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found that the better-designed assessments can be helpful for understanding a variety of aspects of myself and others. I always use myself as the first test subject. Part of my personality (which the best tests confirm!) is a desire to improve myself through observation and understanding, so I can see my strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the insights to help me understand how I can do things such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand where and when I&amp;rsquo;m likely to behave well or badly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Predict how a person will respond to interactions and adjust my approach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate effectively, using a person&amp;rsquo;s natural style instead of my own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Match a person&amp;rsquo;s strengths to a situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask better questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also use assessments, individually and with teams, to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help people understand themselves and their desired career paths.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform pairwise comparisons between people and help coach them through the results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help groups understand how they&amp;rsquo;re similar or different (e.g. sales vs marketing vs engineering) and how to accommodate those differences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine what behaviors, motivations, and skills are required for a role, and in which areas a candidate is a good match for that (job and gap reports).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-kinds-of-assessments-are-there&#34;&gt;What Kinds Of Assessments Are There?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, many assessments try to examine a person from a few viewpoints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Behaviors. These are externally observable tendencies. Generally they focus on a person&amp;rsquo;s preferred style of behavior, sometimes under a variety of situations such as stress. Behaviors often include the style of interaction with others as well as alone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motivators. These &amp;ldquo;values&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;driving forces&amp;rdquo; are internal preferences or situational factors that can help explain &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; a person behaves as they do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Competencies. Tests of competency try to evaluate how well a person achieves specific types of tasks. Some tests try to evaluate &amp;ldquo;raw intelligence,&amp;rdquo; while others evaluate specific skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Worldview. These assessments rate a person&amp;rsquo;s attitudes and opinions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Differences. Some assessments don&amp;rsquo;t try to judge what a person is good/bad or high/low at, but where they&amp;rsquo;re unusually different from other people; in other words, what makes them most uniquely themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found the behaviors and motivators far easier to understand than many of the other types of assessment results. I work with a professional management coach and I&amp;rsquo;m still studying and trying to learn to interpret some of the worldview assessments, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;are-assessments-valid-and-useful&#34;&gt;Are Assessments Valid And Useful?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of controversy over these assessments and their use in hiring or other professional situations. You can do a quick web search and immediately find more information than you need about the usefulness and validity of the assessments. For example, a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cio.com/article/2861657/it-skills/are-personality-assessments-effective-hiring-tools.html&#34;&gt;CIO article&lt;/a&gt; concludes that personality assessments need to be used carefully but can be valuable, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/27/study-delivers-bleak-verdict-on-validity-of-psychology-experiment-results&#34;&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt; reports that psychology studies across the board don&amp;rsquo;t stand up well to rigorous science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After using them for a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to the opinion that there really are good assessments, but the bad assessments give all of them a bad reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But even the best assessments are imperfect. They&amp;rsquo;re based on statistically likely observations about large populations of people, and in my experience are often pretty accurate predictors, but not always. I&amp;rsquo;ve known a couple of people for whom specific results were quite wrong. Part of this comes down to how the person takes the assessment, and some kinds of personalities are actually harder to analyze than others. In other words, some people are naturally going to give answers that result in highly accurate outcomes, and some people will micro-analyze and defeat the test while they take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/10/mac-desktop.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;mac&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to be careful when using the assessments in hiring, in particular. If you base a hiring decision on an assessment that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been subjected to adverse impact analysis, you could open yourself to claims of discrimination. I use the results to help me have a better conversation with the candidate, not to make a hire/reject decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the tests are just fluff. They&amp;rsquo;re like horoscopes, designed to sound meaningful for everyone. In fact, there have even been experiments on how much people believe personality assessments. (People believe the tests are accurate, even when the results are copy-pasted from an astrology book and everyone got the same answers. This is known as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnum_effect&#34;&gt;Barnum effect&lt;/a&gt;. You can take this &lt;a href=&#34;http://forer.netopti.net/&#34;&gt;bogus assessment&lt;/a&gt; yourself; after doing so, see how good you think the results are. This is a good trick to play on your friends.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, you can usually tell the smoke-and-mirrors tests by looking at how polished and slick the reports are. The better tests are usually more concerned with information than appearances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In particular, my personal belief is that the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which is the most popular and well-known by far, is not very revealing. After you&amp;rsquo;ve studied other assessments for a while, the MBTI looks weak in comparison. I&amp;rsquo;ll let you study this on your own if you&amp;rsquo;re interested. For a little light reading you might be interested in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/03/29/for-holy-week-heres-how-you-can-match-your-myers-briggs-personality-type-to-a-patron-saint/&#34;&gt;how the MBTI types match up to patron saints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The better-quality assessments are based on well-known models of human psychology that were invented/discovered by researchers and have subsequently been commercialized, often by many companies. The Big Five and the DISC model are examples. There are many implementations of these models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When researching personality assessments online, I would caution you to take what you find with lots of skepticism. Predicting whether a person is a good fit for a job is an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; interesting outcome for companies, because hiring the best people and avoiding bad hires is often the difference between success and failure as a business. As a result, the companies that develop and administer the tests are making &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; good profits, and sometimes go to extremes to ensure that the information available online makes them look good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Wikipedia is not immune to this effect. Many articles about the assessments are full of weasel words and blatant advertising, and few people in the general public have the knowledge or motivation to properly moderate the articles, so you end up with claims like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The [redacted] has been considered the &amp;ldquo;gold standard&amp;rdquo; in personality testing&lt;sup&gt;[citation needed]&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, my personal view is that any test that is offered &lt;em&gt;exclusively&lt;/em&gt; by a single company is suspect. I give more credence to models that were developed by researchers and then implemented by companies. I am also skeptical of companies that make sweeping claims such as &lt;em&gt;The XYZ assessments are ideal for a wide range of applications&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt; In my opinion, no assessment is &amp;ldquo;ideal&amp;rdquo; for anything, much less a &amp;ldquo;wide range&amp;rdquo; of things. Unfortunately, even the tests that I believe are good use verbiage like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A word of caution: just because the questions you have to answer during the assessment seem vague or contradictory doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it is fluff. Many of the personality tests are designed to force you to compare and rank things that aren&amp;rsquo;t directly comparable. By doing this in a variety of dimensions, they are able to use factor analysis to get multi-dimensional results. This is a legitimate statistical technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;available-assessments&#34;&gt;Available Assessments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a stunning range of assessments available, ranging from amateur to academic to professional. For personal interest, they might all be fun to use, but for professional purposes I&amp;rsquo;d stick with ones that have invested in large-scale, longitudinal studies of effectiveness and adverse impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessments and companies that are widely used in business, from what I observed through discussions with various managers and recruiting specialists, are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ttisuccessinsights.com/&#34;&gt;TTI Success Insights&lt;/a&gt;, which is the company my coach and I use; it&amp;rsquo;s also what many companies such as the Rainmaker Group resell.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.calipercorp.com/&#34;&gt;Caliper Hiring Assessments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.criteriacorp.com/solution/SalesAP.php&#34;&gt;Criteria Employment Tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://chally.com/solution-suite/predictive-assessments/&#34;&gt;Chally predictive assessments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.harrisonassessments.com/&#34;&gt;Harrison Assessment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.salesgenomix.com/&#34;&gt;SalesGenomix sales talent assessments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.innermetrix.com/products/assessments/&#34;&gt;InnerMetrix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the companies mentioned provide a range of assessments such as DISC and Big Five. Many of them also provide a free assessment, so if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in taking one for yourself, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay a lot of money for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some other resources online, each offering one or multiple tests:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://personality-testing.info/&#34;&gt;personality-testing.info&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.outofservice.com/bigfive/&#34;&gt;The Big Five&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.keirsey.com/&#34;&gt;The Kiersey Sorter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.123test.com/&#34;&gt;A variety of free psych tests&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tonyrobbins.com/disc-profile/&#34;&gt;Tony Robbins&amp;rsquo;s test website&lt;/a&gt; provides InnerMetrix DISC and Values tests for free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are some &lt;a href=&#34;http://ipip.ori.org/&#34;&gt;collaborations amongst scientists for free and open study&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/j/5/j5j/IPIP/&#34;&gt;free online version of the NEO PI-R test&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But wait, there&amp;rsquo;s more. Here are some other tests I&amp;rsquo;ve seen but haven&amp;rsquo;t examined much:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FIRO-B. I didn&amp;rsquo;t take a much deeper look because after examining one person&amp;rsquo;s report I concluded it wasn&amp;rsquo;t very useful. It&amp;rsquo;s also administered and sold by CPP, the company that promotes MBTI. I distrust it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Interpersonal Style Inventory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-disc-model&#34;&gt;The DISC Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most widely commercialized personality models is the DISC model. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the ones I use, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably one of the best to get started with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISC is an acronym for four dimensions of a person&amp;rsquo;s behavioral style&amp;mdash;things that are externally observable. Each dimension can rank from very low to very high. There&amp;rsquo;s a fair amount of interplay amongst the dimensions, and various combinations of them tend to indicate different things. In my own words, here&amp;rsquo;s a gross oversimplification:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The D stands for Dominance, sometimes called Directness. It relates to how you respond to challenges in your external environment: do you attack them forcefully and aggressively (high-D) or do you avoid or try to solve them indirectly? A person who&amp;rsquo;s high D gets right to the point and pushes themselves and others, and also in my experience tends to become very Defensive when challenged or coached.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The I stands for Influence, or Interactivity, and relates to how much you try to persuade others. A high-I person can win people to their point of view, typically by promoting its benefits. They are also similarly attracted to nice things themselves, and can sometimes be distracted by &amp;ldquo;shiny objects&amp;rdquo; or aesthetically pleasing things or experiences. A high-I person also tends to need lots of social interaction and may like being praised, especially in public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The S stands for Steadiness or Stability, and relates to preferred working style. A high-S person is patient and a focused single-tasker; a low-S person is a plate-spinning multi-tasker who&amp;rsquo;s easily distracted and likes instant gratification. High-S people also get stressed when placed in multi-tasking situations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The C stands for Compliance or Caution. High-C people care a lot about the world&amp;rsquo;s rules, standards, and procedures, and they want to make sure they&amp;rsquo;re following the rules because they believe that provides safety. Low-C people think rules are for controlling other people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people are high in two dimensions and low in the other two. It&amp;rsquo;s a little less common, but people can be moderately high in a few, and I&amp;rsquo;ve even seen a few people who were high in three categories. Programmers, for example, tend to be high-S, high-C. Many salespeople are high-I and either high-D or high-S.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find many places to take the DISC test, such as TTI Success Insights&amp;rsquo;s website, Tony Robbins&amp;rsquo;s website, and some of the free testing sites I linked above. I have taken lots of those tests and gotten almost exactly the same results from all of them, no matter which provider I used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also asked about 20 of my friends to take some of these tests and share the results with me so I could practice studying and understanding people&amp;rsquo;s personalities. I feel this has helped me be more observant and a better judge of character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TTI Success Insights and Tony Robbins&amp;rsquo;s test website both provide free DISC and Values tests. The benefit of adding the Values test is that the assessment tries to help you understand potential strengths and conflicts between the ways you like to behave, and the things that motivate you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Five tests are similar to DISC in some ways, but I don&amp;rsquo;t find it as easy to apply or understand. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say it is inaccurate, but it feels incomplete to me, as though some of the things it measures are secondary rather than primary, and there are some primary things missing (e.g. how aggressive someone is). This may be a function of how familiar I am with DISC, rather than an objective judgment of the models. To be fair, DISC doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem fully faithful in my experience either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivators-models&#34;&gt;Motivators Models&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Values are the things a person cares about&amp;mdash;what motivates them. Unlike behaviors, which seem to be pretty steady for a lot of people over the long term, values are sometimes situationally driven and can change, especially with major life events such as getting married, having children, moving, or changing jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TTI&amp;rsquo;s motivators are theoretical, utilitarian, aesthetic, social, individualistic, and traditional. The InnerMetrix motivators (values) are aesthetic, economic, individualistic, political, altruistic, regulatory, and theoretical. Although they use similar names, I think the meanings are a bit different in some nuances. I don&amp;rsquo;t prefer one of these to the other, but I&amp;rsquo;m more familiar with the TTI assessments because I&amp;rsquo;ve used them a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: TTI&amp;rsquo;s new Driving Forces assessment is based off the motivators
assessment but is more nuanced and some of the items are renamed to reflect
that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example, using the TTI Driving Forces assessment. One of the
dimensions, Utilitarianism, varies between Selflessness and Resourcefulness.
Selfless - People who are driven by completing tasks for the greater good, with
little expectation of personal return.
Resourceful - People who are driven by practical results, maximizing both
efficiency and returns for their investments of time, talent, energy and
resources. In other words, resourceful people do things
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/intent/&#34;&gt;intentionally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another dimension is what motivates how you behave towards others. Now called
Others, previously called Social, it ranges from
Altruistic (People who are driven to assist others for the satisfaction of
being helpful or supportive) to
Intentional (People who are driven to assist others for a specific purpose, not just for the sake of being helpful or supportive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these dimensions relate to the expected outcome of a decision or
activity: do you do it for the greater good, or to achieve a goal? I&amp;rsquo;ve found
this to be extremely revealing about people. It&amp;rsquo;s not to say one is good or bad;
all of these dimensions are good for different things. Picture an EMT versus a
hospice care nurse, or the way a real estate developer feels about a plot of
land versus how a biologist or forest service worker does. You can probably
predict which types of people are best suited for those jobs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matching people to jobs they&amp;rsquo;re naturally motivated to do results in
effortless, joyful work that doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like work and never gets stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: After a few years using the TTI values assessment, now called Driving Forces, I have grown more and more impressed with it. Watching people react to their assessments hundreds of times, along with observing them in interview settings of 60-90 minutes or even longer, I have come to see it as extremely accurate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;strengths-assessments&#34;&gt;Strengths Assessments&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an open topic of debate whether one should try to work with their strengths and ignore their weaknesses, or try to improve their weak points. Some, such as Drucker in his classic &lt;em&gt;Managing Oneself&lt;/em&gt;, argue that you should find your strengths and use them, because your weaknesses are often hard to improve. I believe that being aware of my weaknesses has helped me to improve some of the &amp;ldquo;low hanging fruit&amp;rdquo; over time, and some weak points are pretty easy to improve dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two projects that try to help people understand their strengths and weaknesses, and particularly their &lt;em&gt;most unique&lt;/em&gt; strengths and weaknesses, are the &lt;a href=&#34;http://strengths.gallup.com/&#34;&gt;StrengthsFinder 2.0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://standout.tmbc.com&#34;&gt;StandOut&lt;/a&gt; assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these have companion books. If you buy the book, you get a code that lets you take the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone recommended the StrengthsFinder book to me. To tell the truth I found it difficult to understand the results. There are way too many dimensions to the report and I don&amp;rsquo;t think all of them are clearly distinguished from each other, and the names and descriptions of them seem to be extremely general as well. Besides, they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to mean what they say; it&amp;rsquo;s as though the terms are redefined instead of using the accepted meanings of the words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did find the StandOut report to be more straightforward, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have found it interesting or highly useful on an ongoing basis. I seem to continue to return to the DISC and Values results for further study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also feel that the DISC and Values results are more well-developed and have benefited from being applied to many more people. For example, they&amp;rsquo;ve been used widely enough that they&amp;rsquo;re evaluated in context of a culture (the report takes into account whether you&amp;rsquo;re a Spanish-speaking American, for example). I think that provides a greater specificity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not use these assessments in hiring. I use TTI&amp;rsquo;s more advanced reports (competencies and worldviews), which are only available in the paid reports. But for low-cost reports I think StandOut is a reasonable one you can use on a personal basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-bhagavad-gita&#34;&gt;The Bhagavad-Gita&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now for something completely different!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Personality profiling and categorization isn&amp;rsquo;t new. The Bhagavad-Gita&amp;rsquo;s last
third contains extensive discussion of the different types of people. It
separates them into three major categories, each influenced by a
&lt;em&gt;guna&lt;/em&gt; (strand or quality).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t take this seriously, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think the last third of this great text
is the most worthy of deep study. But it&amp;rsquo;s still fun and interesting in some
ways to think about how the author of the Gita categorizes people, their modes
of worship, their types of action, the kinds of foods they eat, and so on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the light of knowledge shines forth&lt;br&gt;
through all the gates of the body,&lt;br&gt;
then it is apparent&lt;br&gt;
that &lt;em&gt;sattva&lt;/em&gt; is the ruling trait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greed and constant activity,&lt;br&gt;
excessive projects, cravings,&lt;br&gt;
restlessness: these arise&lt;br&gt;
when &lt;em&gt;rajas&lt;/em&gt; is the ruling trait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Darkness, dullness, stagnation,&lt;br&gt;
indolence, confusion, torpor,&lt;br&gt;
inertia: these appear&lt;br&gt;
when &lt;em&gt;tamas&lt;/em&gt; is the ruling trait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This excerpt is from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Bhagavad-Gita-Translation-Stephen-Mitchell/dp/0609810340/?tag=xaprb-20&#34;&gt;Stephen Mitchell&amp;rsquo;s wonderful new translation of the
Bhagavad-Gita&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusions&#34;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m convinced that the better-quality personality assessments are meaningful and useful, though not perfect. In my opinion they&amp;rsquo;re good tools for personal and professional development of oneself and others, as well as improving interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I use the TTI assessments professionally. I know people who use Caliper, Chally, and Criterion among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For personal use I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to suggest getting the free assessments from any of these, as well as the InnerMetrix ones from Tony Robbins&amp;rsquo;s website (which may also be available for free elsewhere too, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For professional use I would suggest working with an experienced management coach. These companies often have networks of certified professionals who are trained in administering and interpreting their assessments, as well as using them in an ongoing process of improvement. My coach is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.eureconsulting.com/&#34;&gt;Brad Eure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote in quite a bit of detail about the use of personality assessments in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vividcortex.com/resources/building-scalable-dba-team/&#34;&gt;VividCortex&amp;rsquo;s ebook on building and managing a team of database administrators&lt;/a&gt;. That ebook contains actual data from volunteers who took the assessments. It may be interesting further reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Addendum&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;After a lot of further experience with personality tests in the
teams I manage, as well as taking many more tests myself, I am fully convinced
that the TTI Success Insights evaluations, especially the full battery of four
models, is the best on the market. These assessments use models that match human
behavior, values, etc very well. They are also extremely accurate. They resist
&amp;ldquo;gaming&amp;rdquo; and other types of manipulation. The more I use them the more impressed
I am. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/blog/2016/03/27/personality-assessment-values-profile/&#34;&gt;this blog
post&lt;/a&gt; for more on some
of the additional assessments beyond DISC and Values/Driving Forces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Running a conference is hard work, and lots of things need to come together in
just the right way to make it a great experience for everyone. This blog post is
a collection of the most important things I&amp;rsquo;ve seen conference organizers get
wrong (with the best intentions). It&amp;rsquo;s not comprehensive, but I  hope it will
help point out &amp;ldquo;low-hanging fruit&amp;rdquo; for interested people. Hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll be
able to avoid some of the mistakes as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/10/audience.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;audience&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;know-your-audiences&#34;&gt;Know Your Audiences&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I organized my first tech conference in 2008 and I didn&amp;rsquo;t do a great job. I
focused almost exclusively on the experience of the attendees, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t
understand the broader picture. Fortunately others helped and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a
disaster. I learned a lot from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are several audiences at a conference, not a single one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attendees&lt;/strong&gt; typically say they come for great content, fun, networking, and
inspiration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt; usually speak for their own interests, a company&amp;rsquo;s, or
altruistically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vendors or Sponsors&lt;/strong&gt; usually want to attract relevant potential buyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizers&lt;/strong&gt; often have an interest in bringing the attendees and sponsors
together. It might be a company that makes a business from running
conferences, as with O&amp;rsquo;Reilly; or it could be a group of people interested in
promoting a community or technology, as with Gophercon and the Go language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious to state these things, but so often conference organizers
ignore the needs of one of the audiences. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget, too, that there are
others such as the local community (e.g. the restaurants and hotels nearby).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A well-balanced conference is a conscious choice to mix the interests and needs
of all of the audiences as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;food-and-drink&#34;&gt;Food and Drink&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good food and drink (coffee, alcoholic beverages) at a conference is extremely
important. Without these, the conference gets destroyed and reconvened
several times a day. People have to leave and try to find some food, wait in
lines, walk around in the rain, get lost, come back late and miss the talks they
wanted to see (thus disrupting the talks when they enter late)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feed your attendees unless you&amp;rsquo;re right in the middle of a food paradise.
You&amp;rsquo;ll reap the rewards and so will they. Get sponsors to help and it&amp;rsquo;ll be a
virtuous circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What you feed them is also very important. I&amp;rsquo;m gluten sensitive and I can&amp;rsquo;t tell
you how many times I&amp;rsquo;ve walked down a buffet line, only to see literally nothing
I can eat. The menu is things like bread, pasta, sandwiches, couscous salad and
pizza. Not kidding&amp;mdash;gluten (and high carbs/starches) in every single dish. And
what about people with common allergies such as nuts? Salads with nuts in them,
or cheese sprinkled instead of being in a separate dish&amp;hellip; These things aren&amp;rsquo;t
hard to fix. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to accommodate most peoples&amp;rsquo; needs. Just ask for help from
someone whose diet isn&amp;rsquo;t like yours; find a gluten-sensitive vegetarian for
example. There are lots of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;planning-in-advance&#34;&gt;Planning In Advance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many conferences don&amp;rsquo;t plan far enough in advance. Not planning and announcing
things leads to a lot of problems. You have to consider your audiences, again:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sponsors are committing to other events and their calendars are filling up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speakers are too!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All of the attendees, sponsors, and speakers are not only committing to other
things, but may have challenges getting coverage for family needs (babysitter
help while they&amp;rsquo;re away), booking travel at reasonable rates, and the like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wait longer than other shows to open and announce your call for
proposals, in particular, you won&amp;rsquo;t get proposals because other shows will
already have accepted the speakers you want. This typically means at least 6
months, often 8 months. Back out the schedule and see where you need to plan; it
varies depending on the type of event, but you want a good amount of time to
sell tickets (and if there&amp;rsquo;s any travel involved you need to do that much
earlier), a chunk of time for going through various ticket pricing increases
such as early-bird and discount; time for a committee and community to promote
the agenda you&amp;rsquo;ve chosen; time for the committee to choose the speakers and
talks; time for the talks to be submitted; time for the word to get out&amp;mdash;again, you need at least 6 months as a bare minimum for most events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had to miss a lot of great conferences because the organizers didn&amp;rsquo;t plan
and announce far enough in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CfP is particularly important. It needs to be announced and publicized
repeatedly. It&amp;rsquo;s a big effort. It also needs to be highly visible on the
conference website. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen conferences with CfPs inadvertently accessible
only from links in emails and Tweets, not directly linked from the website.
The website needs to promote whatever&amp;rsquo;s stage-appropriate as time passes: the
CfP, registration, and then the schedule/agenda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many conferences I know don&amp;rsquo;t do a good enough job asking last year&amp;rsquo;s speakers
to speak again at future events. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten emails asking me why I didn&amp;rsquo;t
propose talks for a show where I was a speaker in previous years, implying that
I&amp;rsquo;d shunned the conference, when the reality is the conference ignored &lt;em&gt;me&lt;/em&gt;. I
heard nothing about the conference or CfP until the accusatory email. This
should not be hard; use MailChimp or similar to just create a simple email list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very important part of announcement and promotion is to use a guaranteed
delivery format such as email, not a maybe-you-notice-it social media channel. I
have known conferences that rely on Twitter. They didn&amp;rsquo;t realize that a
significant part of their audience was not watching their Twitter account. They
assumed their speakers, in particular, were watching them intently&amp;mdash;when the
reality is the speakers were leading lives doing other things. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten blank
stares at times when I remarked on this being the reason I missed things. Email
is key.  Twitter is auxiliary. Again, build email lists in MailChimp and keep
records in spreadsheets, don&amp;rsquo;t wing it or do it ad-hoc. Otherwise you will miss
important things and important people, and the result will be hurt feelings and
burned bridges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can, announce the next year&amp;rsquo;s date and venue during each show. Many
people and companies really do need to plan a full year in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;speaker-selection-acceptance-and-announcement&#34;&gt;Speaker Selection, Acceptance, and Announcement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to treat speakers respectfully. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t been in their shoes, it
is easy to mess this up badly. Here is a sample of the ways conferences have
inadvertently treated me badly as a speaker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burdensome processes that ask me to jump through hoops&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Taking too long to make a decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failing to confirm acceptance or rejection with me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publishing and promoting my talk before getting my acceptance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accepting my talk publicly, e.g. on Twitter, instead of privately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst speaker management sin an organizer can commit, in my opinion, is
promoting me as a speaker without asking me first. I&amp;rsquo;ve had this happen several
times when I had already made conflicting plans because the conference didn&amp;rsquo;t
plan and announce early enough. Then it looks like I am the jerk for backing
out. Not cool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, the choice of whether to pay speakers (or just reimburse them) is
highly dependent on many factors, so I don&amp;rsquo;t think any universal policy is
appropriate for me to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;conference-format&#34;&gt;Conference Format&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a big fan of single-track conferences. Examples are Monitorama and
Gophercon. The temptation to cram more content in by multi-tracking is strong
and I understand the pressures. Organizers who resist this end up with the
highest quality conferences I&amp;rsquo;ve ever participated in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that big trade shows are a different matter and I&amp;rsquo;ve organized
those too. That&amp;rsquo;s fine, those are necessary. But if you want to respect speakers
and attendees and really achieve a goal of community building and education,
single-track is the way to do it. There is a way to work sponsorship into this,
by the way, although naturally such a conference is less focused on sponsors.
Monitorama does a great job of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;diversity-and-safety&#34;&gt;Diversity and Safety&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a mission statement. Everything changes when you do. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be
public. Just know why you&amp;rsquo;re doing what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; have and enforce a code of conduct. Don&amp;rsquo;t invent one, just copy one
from a conference that does it well and offers theirs for reuse. If you don&amp;rsquo;t
know what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about you really need to do more research on this
yourself. It&amp;rsquo;s beyond the scope of this post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond this, having a diverse committee will produce a much better conference.
You&amp;rsquo;ll avoid all kinds of problems that come from monocultures (such as a
gluten-only menu). These problems are easily avoided; it&amp;rsquo;s a really simple thing
to just get some diversity onto the committee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mission statement and a diverse committee should take care of all the other
things you will care about for your specific event (such as outreach to and
inclusion of a diverse audience and roster of speakers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;give-sponsors-what-they-pay-for&#34;&gt;Give Sponsors What They Pay For&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sponsors/vendors/exhibitors do not want to ruin your conference, they want to
improve it. If you have not been one, you might not understand their needs, and
again you might make simple mistakes that are literally the difference between
them getting their money&amp;rsquo;s worth or you losing next year&amp;rsquo;s sponsorship goodwill.
Here are some simple mistakes I&amp;rsquo;ve seen that wreck things for sponsors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failing to print name and affiliation (company) in large type on badges.
Sponsors at a booth are very busy and they want to save their staff&amp;rsquo;s time as
well as treat the booth visitors well. The name and company need to be visible
from a few paces away. You&amp;rsquo;d be surprised how many people come to a conference
with the express purpose of cruising the expo hall and trying to prey on the
sponsors (e.g. trying to sell them cloud hosting). This gets in the way of
what the sponsors are there for. Name badges solve a lot of this: you can ask
people to move along so you can spend time with the right people.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Failing to print a QR or other scannable code on a badge for sponsors to
efficiently take a record that follow up is needed. This is not evil. It&amp;rsquo;s
time efficiency. People who have no interest in being scanned will not present
their badges for scanning. Sponsors who are savvy are only scanning badges
when there&amp;rsquo;s a good conversation that results in a follow-up request anyway.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not including sponsors in the show. A classic mistake is holding a reception
or open bar outside of the booth area. Shows that lay out the booth area so
that lunch, coffee, and reception traffic flows through it are doing everyone
a favor. Many attendees also want to browse the exhibit hall but can&amp;rsquo;t if they
have conflicting needs (I need to go get my coffee and get back to another
session, I can&amp;rsquo;t make time to go out of my way for the expo!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interfering with conversations in the booth area.  &lt;strong&gt;No loud music in the expo
hall!&lt;/strong&gt; If you have music or a DJ, keep it &lt;em&gt;background&lt;/em&gt;.  Sponsors don&amp;rsquo;t want
to have to lean into people&amp;rsquo;s faces and yell to be heard. At a recent
conference I was literally wiping spit from my face as people at the booth
asked me to demonstrate VividCortex, and repeated requests to turn it down
were not respected over the course of several days. This one&amp;rsquo;s a personal
peeve for me, as people who know me can attest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conferences organized by people who&amp;rsquo;ve been exhibitors are usually easy to tell
from those that are just organized by people who&amp;rsquo;ve spoken/attended. If sponsors
and exhibit areas are afterthoughts it&amp;rsquo;s a waste of time and money for sponsors.
Again, including a diversity of viewpoints on a committee helps avoid simple
mistakes like this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you a sense of how important this is, I do reference checks on every
single conference we decide to sponsor at VividCortex. I will look at last
year&amp;rsquo;s event and see who sponsored, then call or email them and ask if they had
a good experience. I also regularly give feedback to other companies, so I&amp;rsquo;m not
the only one who does this. A lot of conferences that get rave reviews from
attendees (best tech conference I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in years!) are a waste of time for
sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good advice is to think of how to put talks on one side, an expo hall in the
middle, and food and drink either intermingled with or on the other side of the
expo hall. It usually can be done. Few things are more frustrating to a
sponsor than flying across an ocean, setting up a booth, and sitting at the
booth alone for the evening reception/party while all the drinking and talking
is happening two rooms over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the type of conference, it might be appropriate to help publicize
the sponsor&amp;rsquo;s participation. This can be as simple as tweeting about the sponsor
(or sponsored talks), inclusion in newsletters, press releases, all the way up
to dedicated publicity campaigns. It can definitely be overdone, however.
One cloud event is unlike anything I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. They are obviously hiring armies of
social media spam accounts, because there have been thousands of Tweets like the
following (redacted to avoid naming names):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://www.xaprb.com/media/2015/10/cloudexpo.png&#34; alt=&#34;cloudexpo&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s definitely not the way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;be-nice-to-the-organizers&#34;&gt;Be Nice To The Organizers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizing a conference is a stressful job. There are so many potholes you can
step in. Some have serious consequences, such as using PayPal to accept payment
and having all your funds frozen.  That kind of thing can destroy an event (or
even an organizer&amp;rsquo;s personal finances). And a lot of stuff has to be done by the
seat of your pants or at the last minute, unless you&amp;rsquo;re a pro and have it down
to a set of checklists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As such, if you&amp;rsquo;re a sponsor, attendee, or speaker, please try to be nice to the
organizers. They&amp;rsquo;re doing their best. It&amp;rsquo;s much harder than you think it is to
run a conference. (It&amp;rsquo;s also way more expensive.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;lots-of-other-things&#34;&gt;Lots Of Other Things&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are tons of other things that can go wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad wifi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad A/V&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trouble with vendors, unions, and logistics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And so on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, these are largely things that most conference organizers are aware of,
in my experience. They may do a good job or not, but they&amp;rsquo;re not ignorant of it.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to focus on things that conferences seem to get wrong
repeatedly because they&amp;rsquo;re non-obvious mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback is welcome!&lt;/p&gt;
