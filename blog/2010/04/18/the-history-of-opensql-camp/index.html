<p>I got a couple of questions and comments about <a href="http://opensqlcamp.org/">OpenSQL Camp</a> in the past week, and I thought it would be worth noting down the history, because I think there is some difference in perception and memory about this series of events. The following is only my point of view.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-opensql-camp">What is OpenSQL Camp?</h3>

<p>I can say what I had in mind when I created the original event, but this is bigger than me, so I don&rsquo;t get to dictate anything. I wanted a free technical event created entirely by and for a community of open-source databases, in an inclusive sense. Not created or heavily influenced by someone employed by a corporation whose job title includes the word &ldquo;Community,&rdquo; but really by a community themselves. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with Community So-And-So employed at a corporation, but they are by nature a liaison with that company, and it&rsquo;s not the same thing. My original <a href="/blog/2008/04/23/like-it-or-not-it-is-the-mysql-conference-and-expo/">blog post about this topic</a> is probably the clearest explanation of what I had in mind.</p>

<h3 id="who-controls-it">Who controls it?</h3>

<p>Nobody. That&rsquo;s right &ndash; I deliberately abdicated control over things. I wanted it to be decentralized. Centralization is a problem; decentralization prevents problems. As just one example, Sheeri Cabral owns opensqlcamp.org the last I saw, and Technocation tends to be the default conduit for all things financial.</p>

<p>If someone wants to take things in a new direction, then they can do so. I don&rsquo;t know if anyone would show up for an event that didn&rsquo;t really match the spirit that I think is lodged in people&rsquo;s minds now, but there is no stick you can brandish, other than threat of negative publicity.</p>

<h3 id="what-s-the-relationship-with-mysql-camp">What&rsquo;s the relationship with MySQL Camp?</h3>

<p>Nothing whatsoever. MySQL Camp was a series of mini-conferences about MySQL, a particular open-source database. There the resemblance ends. OpenSQL Camp is not &ldquo;the same thing under a different name,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s not even &ldquo;the continuation of MySQL Camp.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s not even a MySQL event. If you want to look at a particular MySQL event and see where a seed was planted, look to the commercial MySQL conference, not the free MySQL Camp; but you&rsquo;d be much better off looking at <a href="http://barcamp.org/beCamp">beCamp</a> as a root than anything to do with MySQL.</p>

<h3 id="if-mysql-camp-wasn-t-the-origin-what-was">If MySQL Camp wasn&rsquo;t the origin, what was?</h3>

<p>I created OpenSQL Camp to set off in a new direction. However, the idea was not fully my own. A brief timeline begins in the Spring of 2008, after I&rsquo;d been to a few MySQL Camp events and could see that something was lacking:</p>

<ol>
<li>After O&rsquo;Reilly/MySQL co-hosted MySQL Conference and Expo (a large commercial event) that year, there was a bit of dissatisfaction amongst a few people about the increasingly commercial and marketing-oriented nature of that conference. Some people refused to call the conference by its new name (Conference and Expo) and wanted to put pressure on MySQL to keep it a MySQL User&rsquo;s Conference.</li>
<li><a href="/blog/2008/04/23/like-it-or-not-it-is-the-mysql-conference-and-expo/">I pointed out that this wasn&rsquo;t going to work</a> and said that if we wanted a user&rsquo;s conference, we needed to take matters into our own hands.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2008/04/23/conference-for-mysql-users/">Peter Zaitsev</a> agreed, and together with <a href="http://arjen-lentz.livejournal.com/111872.html">Arjen Lentz</a>, created and announced a new Google Group to discuss the matter.</li>
<li>Discussion happened on the new <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/oursql-conference">mailing list</a>.</li>
<li>After a while, I concluded that the discussion was not headed in a direction that&rsquo;d really make anything happen. There were simply too many different visions of what was needed, and some of them I strongly disliked, so I stopped contributing.</li>
<li>I privately decided (with my wife&rsquo;s consent) to go ahead and organize what I wanted to see. I drew on a couple of people in my hometown who organized a small conference called <a href="http://barcamp.org/beCamp">beCamp</a> and got things going. I found a venue, initial sponsors, did some initial work on things like catering, and got speakers to commit to presentations.</li>
<li>Once I had a reasonable amount of support from speakers, and had firmly reserved the venue and date, <a href="/blog/2008/08/26/announcing-opensql-camp-2008/">I announced the event</a>.</li>
<li>Pretty quickly thereafter, a flood of help arrived. In particular, Sheeri and my wife really carried the project forward and did far more work than I did. I might be mixing up the timeline; Sheeri might have already been helping before the public announcement, I&rsquo;m not sure. Brian Aker and others really used their networks to get more support behind the project.</li>
<li>Two more events were held in 2009, and I had absolutely nothing to do with organizing them, which I think is <em>awesome</em>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="when-is-the-next-event">When is the next event?</h3>

<p>I heard a rumor this past week that planning for at least one event is in progress, but isn&rsquo;t public yet. I had not heard this news until then myself, which again I think is awesome. This is exactly the point: nobody needs to get approval from any &ldquo;authority&rdquo; to run these things.</p>

<h3 id="surprise-isn-t-very-community-oriented-is-it">Surprise isn&rsquo;t very community oriented, is it?</h3>

<p>This entire conference was born out of an &ldquo;I see a lot of talk but no action&rdquo; kind of situation. I generally don&rsquo;t believe in surprise when a community is involved, but sometimes there is a lot of chatter, and talk is actually preventing action &ndash; to get things to happen, you actually have to stop talking. These events were born out of my realization that two things were true:</p>

<ol>
<li>There was an invitation and call to action but nobody took it, so I didn&rsquo;t need to feel bad about going off and doing something myself.</li>
<li>If I tried to involve anyone in the early stages of planning, it would just regress back to the arguments over differing visions of the event.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes, it&rsquo;s simply time to shut up and do stuff.</p>
