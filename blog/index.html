        <span class="post-date">Sun, Oct 30, 2016</span>
        <p>Computer systems, and for that matter all types of systems that receive requests
and process them, have a response time that includes some time waiting in queue
if the server is busy when a request arrives. The wait time increases sharply as
the server gets busier. For simple M/M/m systems there is a simple equation that
describes this exactly, but for more complicated systems this equation is only
approximate. This has rattled around in my brain for a long time, and rather
than keeping my notes private I&rsquo;m sharing them here (although since I&rsquo;m still
trying to learn this stuff I may just be putting my ignorance on full display).</p>

        <span class="post-date">Mon, Apr 18, 2016</span>
        <p>I have a vacant board seat at VividCortex, and I&rsquo;m making diversity one of my priorities as I begin to search. I&rsquo;ve discussed this with a range of people over the last several months. Nearly everyone has asked me to clarify what I&rsquo;m trying to achieve, and why. Some have challenged me to defend why I believe diversity is a must-have at this stage of VividCortex&rsquo;s growth. In the end, it&rsquo;s my job to make the call. I&rsquo;ve decided that diversity is a priority (not the sole priority, but a priority) now, not later. Here&rsquo;s why&mdash;and here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;m following through on that decision.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Mar 27, 2016</span>
        A few months ago I wrote about the DISC and Driving Forces personality assessments I&rsquo;ve been using for the last couple of years, to help me be more intentional about my team interactions and hiring. This post is about another model I use too.
As Michael Gorsuch tweeted, &ldquo;healthy and effective teams are composed of individuals actively seeking to understand each other&rsquo;s needs.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t have said it better. I find personality assessments helpful in several ways, including assessing candidates and coaching team members.

        <span class="post-date">Sun, Feb 21, 2016</span>
        <p>I noticed recently that Google Play Music has a set of features I wasn&rsquo;t aware
of before, and decided to give it a try. Through various kinds of <a href="http://projects.csail.mit.edu/gsb/old-archive/gsb-archive/gsb2000-02-11.html">yak
shaving</a>,
I ended up tackling a project I&rsquo;d wanted to look into for a while: <strong>which
formats and settings are really the best for lossy music compression?</strong></p>

<p>What I learned was both fun and surprising, and ultimately highly practical. If
you&rsquo;re in a hurry, the summary is that high-quality variable-bitrate MP3
produced with the LAME encoder is probably the best all-around choice if you
want broad compatibility; if you want the best sound quality, though, AAC (Apple&rsquo;s native format) or Ogg Vorbis are much better than MP3.</p>

<p>But before I get to that, let&rsquo;s sharpen some yak razors, shall we?</p>

        <p>When someone shares your blog article on a social network, odds are it will
appear with some descriptive text, images, and so on. If your blog lacks
explicit instructions, in many cases these properties are just guessed-at and
won&rsquo;t be great.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of blog authors and template creators go too far the other
direction and add tons of redundant meta tags, which will make the page larger,
heavier, and slower.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the minimal necessary set of tags?</p>

        <p>In the last couple of weeks, there have been a few blog posts about benchmarks
comparing the performance of various versions of MySQL and variants such as
MariaDB. There&rsquo;s also been some analysis of the results using formal models such
as Neil Gunther&rsquo;s Universal Scalability Law.</p>

<p>What can the Universal Scalability Law (USL) teach us about the performance
characteristics of these systems, as revealed by the benchmarks? To find out,
I&rsquo;ll examine one particular benchmark, <a href="https://blog.mariadb.org/maria-10-1-mysql-5-7-commodity-hardware/">MariaDB 10.1 and MySQL 5.7 performance
on commodity hardware</a>.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Nov 10, 2015</span>
        <p>At Velocity/OSCON 2015 in Amsterdam a couple of weeks ago, the conference
committee approached me to ask if I&rsquo;d be up for doing an Ignite talk. It was
rather last-minute and I had only hours to prepare. I said yes and then tried to
think of a topic. I turned to Twitter and asked, if you could have me talk for 5
minutes on any topic, what would it be? A couple of people responded that they
wanted to know what founding a company was like, so I sat down in the speaker
lounge at the RAI and started trying to figure out what it&rsquo;s like to be a
founder/CEO.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d know after three years, but truthfully, it&rsquo;s still hard to
really know what I feel.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Sat, Nov 7, 2015</span>
        <p>I was talking with someone the other day about a visualization I remembered
seeing some years ago, that could help set a reasonable value for a threshold on
a metric. As I&rsquo;ve
<a href="https://www.vividcortex.com/blog/2013/04/10/2-reasons-why-threshold-based-monitoring-is-hopelessly-broken/">written</a>,
thresholds are basically a broken way to monitor systems, but if you&rsquo;re going to
use them, I think there are simple things you can do to avoid making threshold
values <em>completely</em> arbitrary.</p>

<p>I couldn&rsquo;t find the place I&rsquo;d seen the visualization (if you know prior art for
the below, please comment!) so I decided to just blog about it. Suppose you
start off with a time series:</p>

conference for the Silicon Valley PostgreSQL community and beyond, featuring
leading PostgreSQL performance and scalability experts. It&rsquo;s happening November
17-18 at the South San Francisco Conference Center. I encourage everyone in the
area to attend, since this is likely to be the best Postgres conference held
thus far in the Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>I also urge you to <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pgconf-silicon-valley-2015-tickets-16521286613">buy your tickets</a> before they sell out! Of course, the earlier
you buy, the more you save, too. (Use SeeMeSpeak for a 20% discount).</p>

<p><img src="/media/2015/10/ssfcc.jpg" alt="Convention Center" /></p>

        <p>A while ago I wrote a blog post about <a href="/blog/2014/06/08/time-series-database-requirements/">time series database
requirements</a> that has been
amazingly popular. Somewhere close to a dozen companies have told me they&rsquo;ve
built custom in-house time series databases, and that blog post was the first
draft of a design document for it.</p>

<p>One of the things I said in the post was that I had no use for the &ldquo;tagging&rdquo;
functionality I&rsquo;ve seen in time series databases such as OpenTSDB. I&rsquo;ve since
reconsidered, although I think the functionality I now want is a bit different.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Tue, Oct 6, 2015</span>
        <p>Running a conference is hard work, and lots of things need to come together in
just the right way to make it a great experience for everyone. This blog post is
a collection of the most important things I&rsquo;ve seen conference organizers get
wrong (with the best intentions). It&rsquo;s not comprehensive, but I  hope it will
help point out &ldquo;low-hanging fruit&rdquo; for interested people. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll be
able to avoid some of the mistakes as a result.</p>
