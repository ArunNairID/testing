  <p>I want to follow up on my earlier article about <a href="/blog/2006/01/28/captchas-done-better/">how to do CAPTCHAs without images</a>, for accessibility and usability. In that article I hoped my simple scheme would deter dumb robots, cutting down on the bulk of the comment spam I was getting.</p>

<p>It did cut out the comment spam &ndash; for a while. After a while, though, I started to get some spam again. I could see the spammer was either doing it manually, or had figured out that my form submission included the ID of the question I&rsquo;d asked (wow, you spammers <em>sure are smart</em>). I tried changing the questions once or twice, thinking they might be automated set-and-forget spambots that would not get updated for a while. This seemed to have no effect at all. &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just put up with a few spam comments every now and then.&rdquo; Then it became 10 a day. That bothered me, but still not enough to do anything about it.</p>

<p>But then some @$$ started really slamming me. It was all about buying medications and online poker and so forth. It&rsquo;s funny how easy it is to detect which spammer is which by the message style, too. The phrasing is always the same. I could tell this one was new. And I was getting hundreds of spam comments a day.</p>

<p>I tried a Bayesian filter plugin for WordPress briefly, but it didn&rsquo;t work quite right and I didn&rsquo;t have enough time to learn about WordPress&rsquo;s plugin architecture to fix it. During that trial, comments were totally disabled on the blog. I couldn&rsquo;t let that continue, so I uninstalled the plugin and kept moderating while I hoped for a few spare minutes to find a fix.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, even my posts about not using image CAPTCHAs were getting slain. Oh, the irony!</p>

<p>Finally, I managed to find a half-hour to tweak my image-less CAPTCHA system. Instead of posting back which question was on the comment form, I made it set up a session and store which question, like traditional CAPTCHA systems. I really didn&rsquo;t want a heavy-weight solution where I stored the information in an actual session or in a relational database. I wanted it to be just enough to deter spammers, as before. So this time I used some encryption, some randomization, and a known bit of data that changes frequently &ndash; though I won&rsquo;t say what that is &ndash; to generate a passkey and put it in a cookie. The cookie is valid only for one request, and is time-sensitive too. And since the secret changes frequently, hopefully it&rsquo;s not obvious how this all works (though, as before, it wouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to figure it out if you approach it from a &ldquo;what would be easiest for him to do&rdquo; point of view).</p>

<p>Basically, I went from a stateless and easily hackable system to one with a bare minimum of statefulness, and I guess it was just enough to foil the spammers. I haven&rsquo;t gotten a single spam comment since. This is like being in an airplane and putting noise-blocking headphones on. It is blessed, blessed relief. And I&rsquo;m really happy because I seem to have found &ndash; at least temporarily &ndash; just the right balance between people and robots.</p>

<p>Now, the only thing left is to wait and see how long it takes the spammers this time. I promise, I will fight image CAPTCHAs till the last resort is exhausted. Who knows how it will work out? I&rsquo;ll certainly let you know!</p>
