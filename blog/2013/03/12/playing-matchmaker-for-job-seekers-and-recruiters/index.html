  <p>One of the most rewarding things you can do is help someone get a great job or hire a great person for the position they need to fill. I have traveled a lot, written books, done a bunch of consulting, and spoken widely on MySQL, other databases, open source, and so forth. I&rsquo;ve gotten to know a lot of people, some I&rsquo;d call good friends, and many of them are leading large organizations. I think this is both a privilege and a serious responsibility.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a privilege because I can ask some of these people for help or introductions or advice sometimes. It&rsquo;s a responsibility because I need to be ready to do something for them, too. In many cases it&rsquo;s a pay-it-forward kind of readiness.</p>

<p>Many, many people contact me looking for people to hire. I keep a list. When someone tells me they are on the job market, I try to match them with openings I&rsquo;m aware of, if any are appropriate. (Many fewer people tell me they&rsquo;re looking for jobs than tell me they&rsquo;re trying to recruit.)</p>

<p>These are my friends, on both sides. I don&rsquo;t introduce people unless I think everyone is really genuinely bringing something great to the table. A great position &ndash; a great talent &ndash; the right circumstances and attitudes.</p>

<p>When I do introduce people, I usually do it one-sidedly, depending on the situation. For example, I&rsquo;ll forward the candidate&rsquo;s resume and contact information sometimes, with a few words of introduction. At other times I&rsquo;ll just BCC the candidate. Or I might send the recruiting party&rsquo;s information to the candidate.</p>

<p>People usually take this very seriously, but occasionally I&rsquo;ve referred several people to a company only to find out that the company didn&rsquo;t follow up on the introduction. That&rsquo;s pretty much the last chance that company will get from me. If I made a special personal effort to send you someone fantastic who&rsquo;s really qualified for the job, and you didn&rsquo;t contact that candidate, there&rsquo;s really no excuse for such rudeness. You&rsquo;re telling me you don&rsquo;t think my experience and judgment about who&rsquo;s good for the job is valid. I won&rsquo;t offer it again, then.</p>

<p>Recruiters are an interesting lot. They have a bad reputation, and I think that&rsquo;s because a few aggressive, pushy people poison the well for the rest of the recruiters. Most recruiters are really good people doing a hard and extremely valuable job, with a lot of care and personal attention to their client as well as their candidates. If you&rsquo;ve ever built a team, you know how hard it can be. Many recruiters are used to being treated very badly because of their profession&rsquo;s reputation. I try to make up for that by being extra nice to them. Recruiters who contact me by email often get a personal call in return, and always a personal email reply with a thank you. In almost all cases, recruiters will tell me who their client is after I&rsquo;ve introduced myself. I only refer my friends to recruiters when I know who they&rsquo;re recruiting for, and I never make an end run around recruiters. They are doing a mostly thankless job, and they should not be cheated out of their commission.</p>

<p>Over the years I&rsquo;ve been lucky enough to help a half dozen friends find jobs, and there&rsquo;s pretty much no better feeling. If you&rsquo;re looking, let me know. I know really good people who are looking for you. I&rsquo;m never too busy to help make introductions.</p>
