  <p>At the MySQL conference, a person who used to hold an important position in an important sales organization told us something like the following: &ldquo;You know, you guys at Percona are great, but you have a big problem. You don&rsquo;t have any $500,000 customers who only file one support incident per year. Those customers are where you can really make big money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were well aware of the investigations this person did into which customers are the most profitable, and we had decided a long time ago that chasing huge sales without delivering matching services is flawed. I told this person as much: &ldquo;that model is fundamentally broken because it doesn&rsquo;t align cost with value delivered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Actually, we do have customers who rank in the top 50 of the Fortune 500. I&rsquo;m thinking of one right now. They filed only one case so far. And they&rsquo;ve paid us for exactly the amount of hours we spent on that case. And far from being a problem, this is exactly where we&rsquo;re doing things right.</p>

<p>Some people may see us as shrinking the pie by billing just a few thousand dollars for &ldquo;huge jobs.&rdquo; They might think we&rsquo;re silly for telling the customer that a few hours on the phone and remotely is going to be better for them than a week onsite. They may consider us small peanuts because we don&rsquo;t have 10-million-dollar deals. What they are missing is what the customers see clearly: it&rsquo;s good to write win-win contracts and leave something on the table. If it looks like table scraps to Mr. Million Dollar Salesman, that&rsquo;s okay. Those bloated &ldquo;profitable&rdquo; contracts are short-term thinking, and they&rsquo;re actually a serious weakness. Don&rsquo;t celebrate our &ldquo;problem&rdquo; too much. Keep an eye in the rearview mirror. Is it a problem, or is it our secret sauce?</p>

<p>One problem I think we might actually have is how to get a good sales person with our model. You see, we don&rsquo;t actually have any sales staff at all right now. I am not sure the math would work out the way a traditional sales person would like. But that&rsquo;s because a traditional sales person is used to being rewarded for &ldquo;earning money for the company,&rdquo; which I think is really broken, at least in the way it&rsquo;s traditionally implemented.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve said before that I think one of the reasons <a href="/blog/2008/12/23/does-mysql-really-have-an-open-source-business-model/">MySQL was unable to create an open-source business model</a> is that their sales folks pushed the company in the direction of closed source. I&rsquo;m honestly not sure what the best open-source sales model is. I know that I really feel good about our services delivery model and our pricing model; right now our sales model is nonexistent. We are passive; we just answer inquiries and sign contracts. As things stand now, nobody&rsquo;s <em>doing</em> any sales.</p>

<p>Still, I think this is a good problem to have, and I trust that the right person will come along and see the opportunity to create a good salary at the same time as really providing a service to Percona and the customers. That person will explain to us how cost (salary) and value (service to us and customers) can be impedance-matched too. And that will probably be an innovation, or at least unconventional. With all the other ways Percona is unconventional, I don&rsquo;t expect us to create a conventional sales model either.</p>
